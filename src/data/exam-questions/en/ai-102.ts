      topic: 'Plan and Manage Azure AI Solutions',
      question:
        'Your team plans to call several Azure AI services from a single SDK using one endpoint and one key, and bill the usage to a single resource. Which resource should you provision?',
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'A separate single-service resource for each AI service.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'An Azure Machine Learning workspace only.' },

        { id: 'd', text: 'An Azure AI services multi-service resource.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        'A multi-service Azure AI services resource exposes one endpoint and one key for several services and consolidates billing. Single-service resources each have their own endpoint and key, which is the opposite of what is needed.',

      topic: 'Generative AI Solutions',
      question:
        'You deploy a GPT-4o model in Azure OpenAI Service with 30K tokens per minute. The application logs frequent 429 responses during peak hours. What is the most direct fix that keeps the same model?',
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Switch the deployment to a Standard pay-as-you-go tier in another region.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'Replace the deployment with a fine-tuned smaller model.' },

        { id: 'd', text: 'Increase the Tokens Per Minute (TPM) quota on the deployment.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        'A 429 from Azure OpenAI signals that the deployment hit its TPM or RPM limit. Increasing TPM on the deployment raises the throttling ceiling. Temperature does not change token consumption.',
