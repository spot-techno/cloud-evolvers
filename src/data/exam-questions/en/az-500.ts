      topic: 'Identity and Access',
      question:
        "An attacker keeps brute-forcing RDP on a production VM. You need to allow on-demand admin access only when it is needed and block port 3389 the rest of the time. What do you configure?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "An NSG rule that always allows TCP 3389 from a known IP." },
        { id: 'b', text: "A Conditional Access policy for the VM." },
        { id: 'c', text: "Just-in-Time VM access in Microsoft Defender for Cloud." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Azure Front Door with WAF in front of the VM." },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "Just-in-Time VM access in Defender for Cloud opens management ports only when an authorised user requests access, then closes them again. A static NSG allow rule leaves the port open all the time, which is what you want to avoid.",
    },

      id: 'az500-2',
      topic: 'Identity and Access',
      question:
        "Finance staff use a SaaS payroll app outside the corporate network. You must require MFA when sign-in risk is medium or high, but allow normal sign-in from a compliant device. Which control do you use?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Microsoft Entra ID Identity Protection sign-in risk policy combined with a Conditional Access policy." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Per-user MFA enabled for every finance user." },
        { id: 'c', text: "A Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Identity Management role assignment." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Microsoft Entra ID security defaults." },
      ],
      correctId: 'a',
      explanation:
        "Identity Protection produces a sign-in risk signal that a Conditional Access policy can use to require MFA only when risk is medium or high. Per-user MFA prompts every sign-in regardless of risk, and security defaults cannot be tuned per signal.",
    },
    {
      id: 'az500-3',
      topic: 'Identity and Access',
      question:
        "Your tenant has 30 admins. Most of them only need elevated rights a few hours per month. You want to keep them as standing eligible for the role and require approval and MFA when they activate. Which feature fits?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Microsoft Entra ID B2B collaboration." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Microsoft Entra ID access reviews." },
        { id: 'c', text: "Microsoft Entra ID Privileged Identity Management with eligible assignments." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Azure RBAC with permanent role assignments." },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "PIM eligible assignments require admins to activate the role on demand and can enforce approval, MFA, and a time limit. Permanent RBAC assignments leave rights standing all the time, which is the risk you want to remove.",
    },

      id: 'az500-4',
      topic: 'Secure Networking',
      question:
        "A web app in an App Service plan is exposed to the public internet. You need a Layer 7 firewall that filters by URL, blocks SQL injection, and uses the OWASP managed rule set. Which service do you put in front of it?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Azure Firewall Standard." },
        { id: 'b', text: "An NSG attached to the App Service subnet." },
        { id: 'c', text: "Azure Application Gateway with WAF." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Azure DDoS Protection Standard." },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "Application Gateway WAF inspects HTTP and HTTPS traffic at Layer 7 and ships with the OWASP managed rule sets. Azure Firewall Standard is a network firewall and does not run the OWASP rules.",
    },
    {
      id: 'az500-5',
      topic: 'Secure Networking',
      question:
        "You want internal apps to reach an Azure Storage account without traffic ever leaving the Microsoft backbone, and the storage account must reject all public traffic. Which combination meets the requirement?",

        { id: 'd', text: "A Private Endpoint on the storage account, with public network access disabled." },
      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        "A Private Endpoint gives the storage account a private IP in your VNet, and disabling public access blocks the public endpoint completely. A service endpoint still uses the public endpoint with VNet identity attached.",
    },
    {
      id: 'az500-6',
      topic: 'Secure Compute',
      question:
        "Your security team must guarantee that the keys protecting an Azure SQL Database transparent data encryption (TDE) cannot be exported and are protected by FIPS 140-2 Level 3 hardware. Where do you store the key?",

        { id: 'd', text: "An Azure Storage account with customer-managed keys." },
      ],
      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        "Key Vault Premium uses HSMs validated at FIPS 140-2 Level 3 and keys generated there cannot be exported. The Standard tier uses software-protected keys that do not meet that hardware bar.",
    },
    {
      id: 'az500-7',
      topic: 'Security Operations',
      question:
        "You want a single dashboard that shows your environment's compliance against ISO 27001, PCI DSS, and the Microsoft cloud security benchmark, with a percentage score per control. Which feature do you open?",
      options: [

        { id: 'b', text: "Microsoft Sentinel workbook gallery." },
        { id: 'c', text: "Microsoft Entra ID access reviews." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Microsoft Defender for Cloud regulatory compliance dashboard." },
      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        "The regulatory compliance dashboard in Defender for Cloud maps your resources against built-in standards like ISO 27001 and PCI DSS and gives a per-control score. Azure Policy alone reports policy compliance without the standard mapping.",
    },
    {
      id: 'az500-8',
      topic: 'Security Operations',
      question:
        "A SOC analyst wants to write a hunting query that lists every sign-in to Microsoft Entra ID from a country where the company has no offices. Which language do they use in Microsoft Sentinel?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "T-SQL." },
        { id: 'b', text: "PowerShell DSC." },
        { id: 'c', text: "Kusto Query Language (KQL)." },
        { id: 'd', text: "JMESPath." },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "Sentinel and Log Analytics queries use KQL. T-SQL is for relational databases and JMESPath is a JSON path syntax used by the Azure CLI.",

      id: 'az500-9',
      topic: 'Identity and Access',
      question:
        "Customers sign in to your retail app with Google or a local email and password. You need a separate identity directory for these external customers, kept apart from your employees. Which service do you use?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Microsoft Entra ID B2B collaboration." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Microsoft Entra External ID for customers (the next-generation CIAM solution)." },

        { id: 'd', text: "Microsoft Entra Domain Services." },
      ],
      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        "Microsoft Entra External ID for customers is the next-generation CIAM solution with social sign-in and a separate directory from your employees. It is not a rename of Azure AD B2C , Azure AD B2C is a distinct legacy product that remains available to existing customers. B2B collaboration is for partner/guest scenarios with other businesses, not retail consumer identity.",

      id: 'az500-10',
      topic: 'Secure Networking',
      question:
        "Admins connect to Windows VMs over RDP. You want to remove every public IP from the VMs and still let admins connect from the Azure portal without a VPN. Which service do you deploy?",

        { id: 'b', text: "Azure Firewall Premium." },
        { id: 'c', text: "Point-to-site VPN." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Azure Front Door Premium." },
      ],
      correctId: 'a',
      explanation:
        "Azure Bastion is a managed jump host inside the VNet that lets admins reach VMs over RDP or SSH from the portal, with no public IP on the target VM. A point-to-site VPN works but still requires a client and does not remove the need to publish a connection to each VM.",
    },
    {
      id: 'az500-11',
      topic: 'Secure Compute',
      question:
        "You must encrypt OS and data disks of Windows VMs with keys you control, and you want OS-level encryption (BitLocker) rather than only platform-level encryption. Which option do you choose?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Server-side encryption with platform-managed keys." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Storage Service Encryption with customer-managed keys." },

        { id: 'd', text: "Azure Information Protection." },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "Azure Disk Encryption uses BitLocker on Windows or DM-Crypt on Linux and stores the key encryption key in Key Vault. Server-side encryption with platform keys does not give you BitLocker inside the guest OS.",
    },

      topic: 'Security Operations',
      question:
        "Defender for Cloud shows a 62 percent secure score for your subscription and lists 14 recommendations. Which action will raise the score the most?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Dismissing the recommendations marked low severity." },

        { id: 'd', text: "Buying Defender for Servers Plan 2 for the subscription." },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "Each recommendation in Defender for Cloud lists the secure score points it adds when remediated. Buying a Defender plan does not in itself raise the score, and dismissing items does not change the underlying posture.",

      topic: 'Identity and Access',
      question:
        "An external auditor needs read-only access to Microsoft Entra ID for two weeks. You must grant the access without creating a member account in your tenant. Which option fits?",

      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "B2B collaboration invites an external identity as a guest while authentication stays in the auditor's home tenant. Assigning Global Reader gives read-only Entra ID access without creating a member or sharing a password.",

      ],
      correctId: 'd',
