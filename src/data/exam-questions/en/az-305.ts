      topic: 'Identity Design',
      question:
        'After a merger, an organization has two Microsoft Entra tenants. End users in tenant A need occasional access to resources in tenant B without IT in tenant B managing accounts. Which design choice fits?',
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Merge tenant A and tenant B into a single tenant.' },

        { id: 'd', text: 'Share service principals between the tenants.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        'Entra B2B with cross-tenant access settings invites users as guests; the home tenant keeps lifecycle management. Merging tenants is not a supported operation and would require a full migration.',

      topic: 'Data Storage',
      question:
        'A global application needs sub-10ms reads in five regions and must support single-region writes with automatic failover. Which service fits best?',

      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        'Cosmos DB delivers global distribution, sub-10ms multi-region reads, and automatic regional failover. SQL Database geo-replication offers read-only secondaries with higher latency than Cosmos.',

      correctId: 'a',
      explanation:
        'Azure Site Recovery replicates continuously and meets RPOs in minutes and RTOs within an hour. Azure Backup cannot achieve a 5-minute RPO; Availability Sets do not protect against a regional outage.',

      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        'Event Hubs handles millions of events, supports partitions for ordering, and exposes a Kafka endpoint so Kafka consumers work unchanged. Service Bus has lower throughput and no Kafka protocol.',

      topic: 'Hybrid Identity',

      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        'PIM makes Owner eligible-only with just-in-time activation, approval, and audit. Conditional Access alone still leaves rights standing 24/7, which is what auditors flagged.',

      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        'A federated model gives BUs ownership of operational data and SecOps a single Sentinel workspace for security signals. A single shared workspace blocks BU isolation and inflates ingestion costs.',

      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        'Session consistency gives read-your-writes, monotonic reads, and monotonic writes guarantees within a client session. It is the recommended level for most multi-region scenarios. Bounded staleness is the strongest option for single-write/multi-read accounts with predictable cross-region lag, but Microsoft explicitly flags it as an anti-pattern for multi-region write accounts. Strong consistency is incompatible with multi-region writes entirely.',
