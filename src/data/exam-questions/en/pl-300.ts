      topic: 'Prepare the data',
      question:
        "An analyst connects Power BI Desktop to an on-premises SQL Server database. They want the source server to perform the joins and filters whenever possible so refresh stays fast. Which Power Query feature should they verify is active?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Query folding.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'Column quality profiling.' },
        { id: 'c', text: 'Incremental refresh.' },
        { id: 'd', text: 'Composite model storage mode.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'a',
      explanation:
        "Query folding pushes Power Query steps back to the source as native SQL so the database does the work. Incremental refresh controls partition reload windows but does not on its own translate steps into SQL.",
    },
    {
      id: 'pl300-2',
      topic: 'Model the data',
      question:
        "A semantic model has a Sales fact table and a Date dimension. The relationship uses OrderDate, but a report needs totals by ShipDate as well without duplicating the Date table. Which DAX function should the developer use inside a measure to activate the inactive ShipDate relationship?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'CROSSFILTER.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'USERELATIONSHIP.' },
        { id: 'c', text: 'TREATAS.' },
        { id: 'd', text: 'RELATED.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        "USERELATIONSHIP, used as a CALCULATE modifier, activates an inactive relationship for the duration of the calculation. CROSSFILTER changes filter direction or cardinality on an already active relationship.",
    },
    {
      id: 'pl300-3',
      topic: 'Visualise and analyse the data',
      question:
        "A sales manager wants a single visual that explains which factors most influence whether a customer churns and lets her select segments to drill into. Which AI visual fits best?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Smart narrative.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'Decomposition tree.' },
        { id: 'c', text: 'Q&A visual.' },
        { id: 'd', text: 'Key influencers.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        "Key influencers ranks the factors that drive a target outcome and supports segment analysis. The decomposition tree breaks a measure down by chosen dimensions but does not surface drivers automatically.",
    },
    {
      id: 'pl300-4',
      topic: 'Deploy and maintain assets',
      question:
        "A workspace owner wants to promote content through dev, test, and production stages, with a single click to compare and deploy between stages. Which Power BI Service feature should they use?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Sensitivity labels.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'Power BI Gateway clusters.' },
        { id: 'c', text: 'OneLake shortcuts.' },
        { id: 'd', text: 'Deployment pipelines.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        "Deployment pipelines provide three managed stages and a compare-and-deploy flow for workspaces backed by Premium or PPU. Sensitivity labels classify content but do not move it between stages.",
    },
    {
      id: 'pl300-5',
      topic: 'Model the data',
      question:
        "A measure that returns Total Sales / Total Orders sometimes errors with #DIV/0! when no orders exist for a slicer selection. Which DAX expression handles this safely without an IF wrapper?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'IFERROR([Total Sales] / [Total Orders], 0).' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'DIVIDE([Total Sales], [Total Orders]).' },

        { id: 'd', text: 'SUMX(Sales, Sales[Amount] / Sales[Orders]).' },
      ],
      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        "DIVIDE returns BLANK by default when the denominator is zero or blank and accepts an optional alternate result. IFERROR works but is slower because it forces the engine to evaluate the error path.",
    },
    {
      id: 'pl300-6',
      topic: 'Prepare the data',
      question:
        "While previewing a column in Power Query, the analyst sees that 5% of values are errors and 12% are empty. Which Power Query view shows these percentages alongside value distribution at a glance?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Schema view.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'Column quality and column distribution.' },
        { id: 'c', text: 'Diagram view.' },
        { id: 'd', text: 'Performance Analyzer.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        "Column quality shows valid, error, and empty percentages, and column distribution shows distinct and unique counts. Performance Analyzer measures visual render times in Power BI Desktop, not Power Query data quality.",
    },
    {
      id: 'pl300-7',
      topic: 'Visualise and analyse the data',
      question:
        "An accessibility review flags that several visuals rely on red and green to show status. What is the most direct fix that keeps the colour cue but works for colour-blind users?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Increase the font size on every visual.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'Remove the colour and use only numbers.' },

        { id: 'd', text: 'Switch the report theme to high-contrast only.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "Pairing colour with a non-colour signal (icon, label, shape) is the standard accessibility guidance. High-contrast mode helps low-vision users but does not solve red-green confusion.",
    },
    {
      id: 'pl300-8',
      topic: 'Deploy and maintain assets',
      question:
        "An analyst publishes a report that connects to an on-premises SQL Server. Scheduled refresh fails with a gateway error. What is the correct gateway type for production scheduled refresh of a shared dataset?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Personal mode gateway.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'On-premises data gateway in standard (enterprise) mode.' },

        { id: 'd', text: 'Azure ExpressRoute.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        "The standard on-premises data gateway supports multiple users and shared datasets in production. Personal mode runs only under one user and is not recommended for shared workspace refresh.",
    },
    {
      id: 'pl300-9',
      topic: 'Model the data',
      question:
        "A developer writes [Profit] = SUM(Sales[Amount]) - SUM(Sales[Cost]). Totals look right at row level but the grand total is too high. The Sales table has a row-level discount column. Which iterator should they use to evaluate profit per row before summing?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'SUM.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'AVERAGEX.' },

        { id: 'd', text: 'CALCULATE.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "SUMX iterates over a table and evaluates the expression in row context, then aggregates. SUM operates on a single column and cannot evaluate row-level arithmetic across columns correctly.",
    },
    {
      id: 'pl300-10',
      topic: 'Prepare the data',
      question:
        "An analyst needs to combine 12 monthly sales CSV files that share the same schema into one query. Which Power Query operation is most appropriate?",

        { id: 'c', text: 'Pivot column.' },
        { id: 'd', text: 'Group by.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'a',
      explanation:
        "Append stacks rows from queries with the same schema. Merge joins queries by matching columns, which is for adding columns, not adding rows.",
    },
    {
      id: 'pl300-11',
      topic: 'Visualise and analyse the data',
      question:
        "A report page has a slicer for Country and another for Region. When a user changes Country on page 1, they want the same slicer state on page 2. Which feature should the analyst configure?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Drillthrough.' },

      ],
      correctId: 'b',

      topic: 'Deploy and maintain assets',
      question:
        "A semantic model in a Power BI Premium per User workspace must refresh hourly during business hours. Power BI Pro workspaces are limited to eight refreshes per day. What is the maximum scheduled refresh frequency available with Premium per User (PPU)?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Eight refreshes per day, the same as Pro.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'One refresh per day for governance reasons.' },

      topic: 'Model the data',
      question:
        "A snowflake design has Product, ProductSubcategory, and ProductCategory as three separate tables linked one to many. The team wants to simplify to a star schema. What is the cleanest fix?",
      options: [

        { id: 'd', text: 'Add a calculated column with PATH() in DAX.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        "A star schema flattens normalised parent tables into one wide dimension table, which improves DAX performance and report clarity. Hiding the tables only changes visibility, not the model shape.",
    },
    {
      id: 'pl300-14',
      topic: 'Prepare the data',
      question:
        "A data analyst wants to share a transformed Customer query across multiple Power BI reports without copying the M code into each file. Which Power BI Service feature is designed for this?",

      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        "Dataflows store reusable Power Query logic in the service so multiple datasets can consume the same prepared tables. A composite model addresses storage modes within a single dataset.",

      topic: 'Deploy and maintain assets',
      question:
        "A finance team must restrict each regional manager to seeing only rows for their own region. Which approach should the analyst implement on the dataset?",

      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        "ALLEXCEPT keeps the Category filter while removing other Product filters, so RANKX numbers products inside their category. RANK.EQ is a valid DAX function, but it takes a column reference rather than a table expression, so the proposed pattern (RANK.EQ inside SUMX) cannot replicate RANKX's per-category ranking. TOPN returns rows, not rank numbers.",
