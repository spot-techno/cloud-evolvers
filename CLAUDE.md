# Cloud Evolvers Training - Claude AI Instructions

## Project Overview
Cloud Evolvers Training is a professional training platform built with React, TypeScript, and Vite, deployed on Cloudflare Pages.

## Brand assets (2026-05-30)

The active Cloud Evolvers wordmark set lives in `public/brand/2026-05-30/`. The header and footer use `cloud-evolvers-wordmark-1024.png` so the company name stays readable. `public/logo.svg` wraps the square profile logo for compact placements.

Use `public/brand/2026-05-30/cloud-evolvers-linkedin-logo-512.png` for profile uploads, `public/brand/2026-05-30/cloud-evolvers-brand-banner-1920x640.png` for wide banners, and `public/cloudevolvers-social-card.png` for Open Graph previews.

## ☁️ Cloudflare MCP Tools Available

This project has **Cloudflare MCP (Model Context Protocol)** tools configured and ready to use for:
- **DNS Management**: Create, update, and delete DNS records for cloudevolvers.com
- **Cloudflare Pages**: Deploy and manage deployments
- **Workers**: Manage serverless functions
- **Custom Domains**: Configure domain routing

### API Tokens Configuration
Cloudflare API tokens are configured via environment variables and are **IP-whitelisted** for security.
- `CLOUDFLARE_DNS_TOKEN` - For DNS operations
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` - For general Cloudflare API access

**When IP-blocked**, use the Global API Key from Azure Key Vault (not IP-restricted):
```bash
CF_GLOBAL_KEY=$(az keyvault secret show --vault-name reactor-prod-kv --name cloudfare-cf-global-api-key --query value -o tsv)
CLOUDFLARE_API_KEY="$CF_GLOBAL_KEY" CLOUDFLARE_EMAIL="yairknijn@gmail.com" CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN="" wrangler <command>
```

Cloudflare credentials are stored in:
- **Local**: `.env` (gitignored) — `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, `CLOUDFLARE_DNS_TOKEN`
- **Azure Key Vault**: `reactor-prod-kv` — `cloudfare-cf-global-api-key`, `cf-mcp-api-token`

See `.env.example` for the expected environment variables. The actual `.env` file is gitignored.

### Deployment Environments

| Environment | URL | Branch |
|-------------|-----|--------|
| **Production** | `cloudevolvers.com` / `www.cloudevolvers.com` | `master` |
| **Test/Preview** | `test.cloudevolvers.com` | PR branches |

## Git Branch Rules (CRITICAL)

- **Default branch is `master`** — NEVER use `main`
- **Always use git worktrees** for feature work — never commit directly on `master`
- PR flow: `feature/*` → squash merge to `master`

## Deployment Verification (CRITICAL)

**Always inspect end-to-end when deploying.** After pushing or merging:
1. **Monitor the CI/CD run** — watch `gh run watch` or check the Cloudflare Pages dashboard until the deploy completes
2. **Inspect the live page** — open the deployed URL and verify the changes are visible and working correctly
3. **Never assume a deploy succeeded** — always confirm visually in the browser before marking work as done

## Critical Rules

1. **NO FAKE DATA**: Never use Math.random() or generated statistics
2. **NO POP-UPS**: Always navigate to actual pages with URLs
3. **NO SCROLLBARS**: Use slice() to limit items, not overflow scrolling
4. **Real Data Only**: Only display confirmed, accurate information
5. **NO HARDCODED PRICES**: All pricing comes from D1 database via the API. NEVER put prices in JSON files, TypeScript constants, or frontend code. Update prices via `/admin/bookings` or the training sessions API. If a course has no scheduled session, show "Contact us" — never a stale number.
6. **Promotions via DB only**: Promotional pricing is managed through the admin dashboard or API by updating the `price` field on training sessions. No hardcoded promotional discount logic in frontend code.
7. **NO GENERIC ICONS**: Do not use generic rounded-corner icons above headings or on cards (Shield, Cloud, Cog, etc.). They look templated and AI-generated. Use real photos, typography, or nothing. If a card has a background photo, that IS the visual — don't stack an icon on top.
8. **LIGHT MODE ONLY**: The site is white/light mode for all pages except blog (which keeps a dark/light toggle). Do not add `dark:` classes to non-blog components.

## Images

Stock photos are stored locally in `public/images/` and sourced from Pexels and Unsplash:
- **Pexels**: `public/images/pexels/` — use the Pexels API or download directly
- **Unsplash**: `public/images/unsplash/` — use the Unsplash API or download directly
- **Training categories**: `public/training-categories/` — photos for each training track card
- **Services**: `public/images/services/` — photos for service pages

When adding new images:
1. Download from Pexels or Unsplash (both have free licenses for commercial use)
2. Save to the appropriate directory with a descriptive filename
3. Reference as `/images/pexels/filename.jpg` or `/images/unsplash/filename.jpg`
4. Prefer real photos over AI-generated or stock illustration art

## Code Quality

- **Clean up as you go**: When touching a file, improve code you find. Remove dead imports, unused variables, duplicated logic, stale comments. Leave it better than you found it.
- **No dead code**: Delete unused files, components, types, and exports. Don't comment out code "for later". Git has history.
- **Single source of truth**: Don't duplicate data across JSON files, TypeScript constants, and the database. Pick one source and derive everything from it.
- **No AI slop**: Write authentic copy. Avoid generic phrases like "empower your journey" or "unlock your potential". Write like a real person.

## Writing rules (CRITICAL, copy and docs)

**No AI-writing tells.** Every piece of site copy, blog post, legal
text, UI string, commit message, and PR description must pass a check
against `docs/writing/signs-of-ai-writing.md`. That file is the source
of truth, adapted from [Wikipedia: Signs of AI writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Signs_of_AI_writing).

Short rules that override the default model style:

- **No em dashes or en dashes** in copy. Use periods, commas, colons, or parentheses.
- **No "if / then / that" sentence scaffolding**. Write direct, declarative sentences.
- **No banned vocabulary**: delve, tapestry, landscape (as "area"), boasts, bolstered, pivotal, crucial, vibrant, showcase, meticulous, intricate, testament, underscore, garner, foster, enduring, seamless, thoughtfully, cohesive, dynamic hub, groundbreaking, renowned, nestled, in the heart of, elevate, unlock, empower. See `docs/writing/signs-of-ai-writing.md` for the full list.
- **No negative parallelism** ("not only X but also Y", "not just X, but Y").
- **No rule-of-three adjective stacks** ("bold, cohesive, and elegant").
- **No trailing "-ing" analysis clauses** ("..., highlighting its significance").
- **No chatbot leakage**: do not ship phrases like "I hope this helps", "Of course", "Certainly", or "As of my last knowledge update".
- **No placeholder strings**: no `[Your Name]`, `INSERT_URL`, `PASTE_..._HERE`, `2025-XX-XX`, or chat UI artifacts in committed files.
- **No emoji in copy or headings** unless the user explicitly asks.
- **No Title Case on every heading**. Use sentence case unless a page uses Title Case intentionally.

Before committing any file that contains copy, grep the draft against the banned words list and fix every match. If a sentence collapses without the banned word, rewrite the sentence instead of swapping synonyms.

## Tech Stack
