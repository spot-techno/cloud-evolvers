      ],
      correctId: 'a',
      explanation:
        'A CanNotDelete lock on the resource group blocks deletion but allows updates. ReadOnly would also block changes, which is not the goal here.',

      question:
        'You use a general-purpose v2 storage account. A log file is no longer read after 30 days and must be kept for another three years for audit. How do you reduce cost without losing data?',
