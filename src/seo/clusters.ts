<h2>The short answer</h2>
<p>AZ-900 is not a formal prerequisite for AZ-104. Microsoft does not block you from scheduling AZ-104 without passing AZ-900 first. If you have hands-on Azure experience already, you can, and probably should, skip AZ-900 and go straight to AZ-104.</p>

<h2>What each exam actually tests</h2>
<p>AZ-900 (Azure Fundamentals) is a 45-minute exam with three skill domains: cloud concepts, Azure architecture and services, and Azure management and governance. It costs <strong>$99 USD</strong> via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-fundamentals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pearson VUE</a>. The questions are conceptual. There are no labs, no CLI tasks, nothing requiring hands-on time in the portal.</p>

<p>AZ-104 (Azure Administrator) is a 100-minute exam with five skill domains: identities and governance, storage, compute, virtual networking, and monitoring. It costs <strong>$165 USD</strong> via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pearson VUE</a>. Questions mix multiple-choice with interactive drag-and-drop and case-study scenarios. Expect PowerShell and Azure CLI syntax to appear.</p>

<h2>The overlap is real but limited</h2>
<p>AZ-900 covers Azure services at a surface level: what is a virtual machine, what is Azure Blob Storage, what is role-based access control. AZ-104 assumes you know those things and tests whether you can actually configure them. There is roughly a 10-15% content overlap. Studying for AZ-900 does not meaningfully prepare you for AZ-104 beyond that overlap.</p>

<h2>Who should skip AZ-900</h2>
<p>Skip AZ-900 if any of the following apply to you:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have worked with Azure for six months or more in any capacity.</li>
  <li>You come from a sysadmin or network engineering background and are pivoting to cloud.</li>
  <li>You are preparing for AZ-104 as your target cert and have a study plan that includes hands-on lab time.</li>
  <li>Your employer is paying for the exam and does not require the fundamentals cert for internal reasons.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who should take AZ-900 first</h2>
<p>Take AZ-900 first if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>You have never worked in IT and want a low-stakes way to confirm that cloud concepts click for you before investing $165 in AZ-104.</li>
  <li>Your organisation requires the fundamentals badge as part of an internal learning programme.</li>
  <li>You are supporting a Microsoft sales or licensing role and the fundamentals cert is the endpoint, not a stepping stone.</li>
  <li>You want a confidence boost on exam mechanics before sitting a harder proctored exam.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Study time estimates</h2>
<p>AZ-900: Most people with some IT background pass in 10-15 hours of study using <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/azure-fundamentals-describe-cloud-concepts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the free Microsoft Learn paths</a>. The free practice assessment on Microsoft Learn is genuinely representative of the real exam.</p>

<p>AZ-104: Expect 60-80 hours of combined study and lab time. The <a href="https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Learning GitHub repo</a> has all 11 official lab exercises. Do them. The exam will test you on tasks, not definitions.</p>

<h2>Salary and employer signal</h2>
<p>AZ-900 alone does not move the needle on job descriptions. Employers list AZ-104 (Azure Administrator Associate) as a hiring criterion; AZ-900 shows up mostly as "nice to have" on non-technical roles. If a pay raise or a new job is the goal, AZ-104 is the cert that counts.</p>

<h2>The recommendation</h2>
<p>If you are reading this to make a decision: skip AZ-900, book AZ-104, and give yourself 8-10 weeks of study with consistent lab time. The $99 saved covers a cloud sandbox subscription for two months. Use <a href="https://cloudevolvers.com/training" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an MCT-led course</a> if you want structured lab guidance; use Microsoft Learn and John Savill's YouTube series if you prefer self-paced.</p>

<h2>CLI check: verify your Azure CLI version before exam prep</h2>
<pre><code># Confirm az CLI is installed and authenticated
az --version
az login
az account show --output table
</code></pre>
<p>AZ-104 lab exercises assume Azure CLI 2.50 or later. The command above confirms you are authenticated to the right subscription before starting lab work.</p>

<p>The question is not which cloud is better. It is which certification track gets you to your next job or your next pay band faster. That depends on where you work, where you want to work, and which cloud your employer runs. Here is how to figure it out.</p>

<h2>Market share and job volume</h2>
<p>AWS has the largest cloud market share globally, around 30-32% as of early 2026 per Synergy Research Group. Azure sits at roughly 21-23%. For raw job count, AWS certifications appear more frequently in job postings across the US and Asia-Pacific. In Europe, especially Germany, the Netherlands, and the Nordics, the gap is narrower: Azure is well-represented in enterprise and public sector roles because of Microsoft's existing ELA relationships.</p>

<p>If you are job-hunting in Europe and you come from a Microsoft stack background (Windows Server, Active Directory, Microsoft 365), Azure certification will directly translate to job requirements you will see. If you are in the US and targeting startups or tech companies, AWS has more volume.</p>

<h2>Exam style and difficulty</h2>
<p>AWS associate exams tend to ask scenario-heavy questions that require selecting the most cost-effective or most resilient architecture from four options. The AWS exam environment heavily tests your knowledge of specific service capabilities and limits (S3 storage classes, EC2 instance families, RDS Multi-AZ vs read replicas). Studying for AWS requires memorising service specifics.</p>

<p>Azure exams mix scenario questions with interactive components: drag-and-drop, build-list, case studies, and active labs in some certifications. AZ-104 in particular has portal-based questions where you configure resources during the exam. Azure rewards hands-on familiarity over rote memorisation of service details.</p>

<h2>Cost to certify at the associate level</h2>
<ul>
  <li>AWS SAA-C03: $150 USD per attempt via <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/certification/certified-solutions-architect-associate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pearson VUE or PSI</a></li>
  <li>AZ-104: $165 USD per attempt via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-administrator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pearson VUE</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The cost difference is small. What matters more is pass rate on the first attempt. AZ-104 has a reputation for a higher first-attempt pass rate among candidates who complete the official lab exercises. AWS SAA-C03 has a 65-70% first-attempt pass rate based on community-reported data on r/AWSCertifications.</p>

<h2>Which to pick based on your situation</h2>
<p>Pick Azure if: you already work in a Microsoft-heavy environment, your employer uses Azure, you want a cert that transfers to architectural and governance roles quickly (AZ-305 builds directly on AZ-104), or you are in the Netherlands, Belgium, or Germany where Azure is dominant in enterprise.</p>

<p>Pick AWS if: you are targeting US job markets, you work at a company running AWS, you want broader market optionality globally, or you prefer the AWS service ecosystem.</p>

<p>Pick both eventually: in practice, cloud engineers with both AWS and Azure certs at the associate level are more hireable than those with only one. Budget 12-18 months to get both associate certs if you are serious about a cloud engineering career.</p>

<h2>CLI example: cross-cloud identity check</h2>
<pre><code># Azure: confirm current subscription context
az account show --output table

# AWS: confirm current identity and region
aws sts get-caller-identity
aws configure get region
</code></pre>
<p>If you are studying for both cloud tracks, running both clouds side by side on your local machine forces the muscle memory that makes the exams easier. Most engineers who hold both certs say that studying the second cloud was faster because the concepts transfer.</p>

    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is AWS or Azure certification more valuable?",
        a: "Neither is universally more valuable. AWS certs have more volume in the US and Asia-Pacific job markets. Azure certs are strong in European enterprise environments, especially in organizations already running Microsoft 365 and Windows Server workloads.",

<p>The FinOps Certified Practitioner (FOCP) is the entry-level certification from the FinOps Foundation. It tests your understanding of the FinOps Framework, the lifecycle, key personas, and the principles that govern cloud financial management. It is not a technical exam. You will not write code, configure billing alerts, or answer questions about AWS Cost Explorer UI specifics. You will answer conceptual questions about how FinOps works as a practice.</p>

<h2>Exam facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cost: <strong>$300 USD</strong> for the exam only, via <a href="https://learn.finops.org/finops-certified-practitioner-certification-exam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn.finops.org</a>. A self-paced course bundle is $599.</li>
  <li>Format: 50 multiple-choice questions, 1 hour, unproctored, online</li>
  <li>Passing score: 75% (37 of 50 correct)</li>
  <li>Attempts: 3 total (1 initial + 2 retakes)</li>
  <li>Validity: 2 years, then renewal required</li>
</ul>

<h2>What the exam covers</h2>
<p>The FOCP is built around the FinOps Framework, which organises cloud financial management into three lifecycle phases:</p>

<h3>Inform</h3>
<p>The Inform phase is about visibility. FinOps practitioners in this phase focus on tagging and allocation strategies, showback and chargeback, unit economics, and cloud cost data pipelines. Exam questions here test whether you understand what "shared cost allocation" means, how tagging hierarchies support chargeback, and what a unit cost metric represents (cost per transaction, cost per user, etc.).</p>

<h3>Optimize</h3>
<p>The Optimize phase is about reducing waste and right-sizing. Questions cover Reserved Instances vs Savings Plans, commitment-based discounts, rightsizing compute, identifying idle resources, and the trade-offs between flexibility and commitment. You are expected to know the general mechanics of each discount type, not the exact percentages for a specific EC2 instance family.</p>

<h3>Operate</h3>
<p>The Operate phase is about embedding FinOps into workflows and governance. Questions cover FinOps personas (practitioner, finance, engineering, leadership), the principles of FinOps (teams need to collaborate, everyone takes ownership), policy enforcement, and how FinOps integrates with product and engineering planning cycles.</p>

<h2>Study resources that actually work</h2>
<p>The primary free resource is the <a href="https://www.finops.org/framework/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FinOps Foundation Framework documentation</a> at finops.org. Read the framework, the principles, and the personas sections. The exam draws questions directly from this content.</p>

<p>The free course materials on learn.finops.org are available without purchasing the exam bundle. Work through them. They map directly to the exam domain structure.</p>

<p>For practice questions: Udemy has multiple FOCP practice exam sets from community instructors. They are not officially endorsed by the FinOps Foundation but the question style is representative. Use them for timing practice, not for content discovery.</p>

<h2>Study plan: 3 weeks, self-paced</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Read the full FinOps Framework on finops.org. Focus on Principles, Personas, and the Lifecycle overview. Make flashcards for the six FinOps principles.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 2:</strong> Work through the Inform and Optimize domain content on learn.finops.org. Do one practice exam set and review every wrong answer against the framework docs.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 3:</strong> Operate domain, second practice exam set, and a final pass through anything you got wrong. Book the exam for the end of the week.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Who should take this cert</h2>
<p>The FOCP makes sense for: cloud architects who work with finance teams, finance analysts entering cloud cost management roles, platform engineers who own cloud spend dashboards, and anyone preparing for the FinOps Certified Professional (FOCP-P) which requires the practitioner cert as a prerequisite.</p>

<p>It does not make sense for: pure DevOps engineers with no cloud finance responsibility, or anyone who wants a cert that validates hands-on cloud configuration skills. This is a conceptual cert.</p>

<h2>FinOps tagging check: a practical example</h2>
<pre><code># Azure: list all resource groups and check for Cost Center tag
az group list --query "[].{name:name, costCenter:tags.CostCenter}" --output table

# AWS: find untagged EC2 instances
aws resourcegroupstaggingapi get-resources \
  --resource-type-filters ec2:instance \
  --tag-filters Key=CostCenter,Values="" \
  --output table
</code></pre>
<p>The Inform phase of the FinOps lifecycle starts with tagging hygiene. The commands above surface untagged resources, which is the first thing a real FinOps practitioner audits in a new environment.</p>

</table>
<p>Troubleshooting is the biggest domain at 30%. Most candidates under-prepare for it. You need to be fast at diagnosing cluster issues: broken kubelet configs, crashlooping pods, misconfigured network policies, and storage mount failures.</p>

<h2>Study approach for ops engineers</h2>
<p>Ops engineers (sysadmin, SRE, platform engineering background) have an advantage on the troubleshooting domain because they already know how to read logs, diagnose service failures, and work methodically under time pressure. The disadvantage is that most ops engineers are less familiar with Kubernetes-specific objects like NetworkPolicy, PodDisruptionBudget, and CustomResourceDefinitions.</p>

<p>Recommended study path:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Weeks 1-2:</strong> Killer.sh CKA simulator (included free with exam purchase). Do every task, read every explanation. This is the closest thing to the real exam environment.</li>
  <li><strong>Weeks 3-4:</strong> Mumshad Mannambeth's CKA course on Udemy is the most complete structured course available. Do the mock exams at the end of each section.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 5-6:</strong> Daily practice on a local <code>kind</code> or <code>minikube</code> cluster. Focus on speed: aim to complete any single task in under 4 minutes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What trips ops engineers up</h2>
<p>The most common failure points for ops engineers taking the CKA:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>NetworkPolicy syntax.</strong> The YAML spec for NetworkPolicy is not intuitive. Practice writing NetworkPolicy manifests from scratch, not from copy-paste.</li>
  <li><strong>etcd backup and restore.</strong> This appears consistently. Know the <code>etcdctl snapshot save</code> and <code>etcdctl snapshot restore</code> commands with all required flags.</li>
  <li><strong>RBAC.</strong> ClusterRole vs Role, ClusterRoleBinding vs RoleBinding. The exam will ask you to create both and test them with <code>kubectl auth can-i</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Node troubleshooting.</strong> You will get a broken node. Know how to SSH to it, check <code>kubelet</code> status with <code>systemctl</code>, and fix common config errors.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Essential kubectl commands to have at muscle memory</h2>
<pre><code># Create a pod imperatively (faster than writing YAML from scratch)
kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --dry-run=client -o yaml > pod.yaml

# Check what is wrong with a node
kubectl describe node &lt;node-name&gt;
kubectl get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'

# RBAC: create a role and bind it
kubectl create role reader --verb=get,list --resource=pods -n default
kubectl create rolebinding reader-binding --role=reader --user=jane -n default

# Verify RBAC
kubectl auth can-i get pods --as=jane -n default

# etcd backup
ETCDCTL_API=3 etcdctl snapshot save /tmp/backup.db \
  --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 \
  --cacert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt \
  --cert=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt \
  --key=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key

# Get all nodes and their status
kubectl get nodes -o wide
</code></pre>

<h2>The open-book strategy</h2>
<p>You can use kubernetes.io/docs during the exam. This is not a lifeline for topics you do not know; it is a reference for exact YAML syntax when you need it. If you are spending more than 90 seconds looking something up, you have not studied enough. Use the docs for: PersistentVolume/PersistentVolumeClaim YAML structure, NetworkPolicy examples, and StorageClass spec fields.</p>

<h2>Time management</h2>
<p>17 tasks, 120 minutes, means roughly 7 minutes per task. Higher-weighted tasks are worth more points. If a task is taking more than 10 minutes, flag it and move on. Come back at the end. Leaving a partially completed high-weight task is worse than leaving it blank and finishing three easier tasks.</p>

<p>AZ-104 (Microsoft Azure Administrator) is the most popular Azure certification at the associate level. The exam costs $165 USD, tests five domains across 100 minutes, and includes interactive case-study questions. Getting the content delivery right matters: a course that is mostly video theory without labs will leave you unprepared for the question types you will actually see.</p>

<p>Here are the courses worth your time, ranked by real-world utility.</p>

<h2>1. Microsoft Learn (free)</h2>
<p>The official Microsoft Learn paths for AZ-104 are free and map directly to the exam objectives. There are 11 learning paths covering every domain. The built-in sandbox environments let you practice without a paid Azure subscription for many exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> People who prefer reading over video and want to confirm they are studying exactly what the exam tests. The free practice assessment on Microsoft Learn is the best indicator of your readiness.</p>
<p><strong>Gap:</strong> No structured lab sequence. You have to assemble the lab exercises yourself from the <a href="https://microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ-104-MicrosoftAzureAdministrator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Learning GitHub repo</a>.</p>

<h2>2. John Savill's AZ-104 Study Cram (free, YouTube)</h2>
<p>John Savill is a Microsoft employee and one of the most credible Azure educators on YouTube. His AZ-104 study cram is a single long-form video (4-5 hours) that covers every exam domain with clear visual explanations. It is not a full course, but it is the best exam-focused overview available for free.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Final week review after you have done the structured study. Do not use this as your only study resource.</p>

<h2>3. Pluralsight AZ-104 path</h2>
<p>Pluralsight's AZ-104 learning path is well-structured, regularly updated, and includes skill assessments that tell you which domains you are weakest on before you sit the exam. The lab integration with Azure sandbox environments is better than most competitors.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Teams with an existing Pluralsight subscription who want a structured track with measurable progress.</p>
<p><strong>Cost:</strong> Pluralsight subscription required (from $29/month).</p>

<h2>4. A Cloud Guru AZ-104</h2>
<p>A Cloud Guru (now part of Pluralsight) offers a dedicated AZ-104 course with hands-on labs in a real Azure environment. The course content is thorough and includes practice exams. Quality has improved since the Pluralsight acquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Candidates who want video instruction plus live lab environments without managing their own Azure subscription.</p>

<h2>5. MCT-led instructor course (Cloud Evolvers)</h2>
<p>An MCT-led course (Microsoft Certified Trainer) is the fastest way to prepare if you are training a team, have a deadline, or want structured feedback on lab exercises. The official Microsoft curriculum is delivered by a trainer who has passed the exam and works with Azure daily.</p>
<p><strong>Best for:</strong> Corporate teams, individuals with exam dates already booked, and anyone who does better with a live instructor than self-paced video.</p>
<p><a href="https://cloudevolvers.com/training" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Browse the Cloud Evolvers AZ-104 training catalog</a> for upcoming course dates and in-company options.</p>

<h2>What the best courses have in common</h2>
<p>Every course that reliably produces passing candidates covers these four things in depth:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Identity and governance (Entra ID, RBAC, policy, management groups)</li>
  <li>Storage (accounts, replication types, lifecycle management, access tiers)</li>
  <li>Compute (VMs, availability sets, scale sets, Azure Kubernetes Service basics)</li>
  <li>Networking (VNets, NSGs, peering, load balancers, Application Gateway)</li>
</ol>
<p>If a course you are evaluating does not include hands-on labs for all four of these, look elsewhere.</p>

<h2>Quick lab check: verify your understanding</h2>
<pre><code># Create a resource group (basic AZ-104 task)
az group create --name rg-exam-prep --location westeurope

# Assign a built-in role (identity domain)
az role assignment create \
  --assignee user@domain.com \
  --role "Contributor" \
  --scope /subscriptions/&lt;subscription-id&gt;/resourceGroups/rg-exam-prep

# List storage accounts (storage domain)
az storage account list --resource-group rg-exam-prep --output table
</code></pre>
<p>If these commands feel unfamiliar, your lab practice time is not yet sufficient. AZ-104 questions will assume you can do tasks like these without looking up the syntax.</p>

        q: "Is Microsoft Learn enough to pass AZ-104?",
        a: "Microsoft Learn provides all the content you need to pass AZ-104, and it is free. The gap is hands-on lab practice. You need to complete the official lab exercises, ideally with a real Azure subscription or the GitHub-hosted lab guides.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long does the AZ-104 course take?",

<p>Cloud engineering is not a single job. It spans infrastructure ops, security engineering, platform engineering, DevOps, and FinOps. The roadmap below is structured for someone starting from a sysadmin or on-premises networking background who wants to move into cloud roles in 2026. Adjust the entry point based on where you already are.</p>

<h2>Stage 1: foundation (0-3 months)</h2>
<p>The goal at stage 1 is to get comfortable with cloud fundamentals and pass a first cert to signal intent to employers.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pick one cloud first.</strong> Azure if you are in Europe or a Microsoft-heavy org. AWS if you are in the US or targeting startups. Do not try to learn both simultaneously at this stage.</li>
  <li><strong>Core skills:</strong> Networking basics (TCP/IP, subnetting, DNS, firewalls), Linux command line, scripting basics (Bash or PowerShell), and an understanding of virtualisation.</li>
  <li><strong>First cert:</strong> AZ-900 (if Azure) or AWS Cloud Practitioner (if AWS). These are 2-4 week commitments and cost under $100. They are not career-defining, but they confirm you know the vocabulary and signal commitment to a hiring manager.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stage 2: associate level (3-9 months)</h2>
<p>This is the most important stage. The associate cert is what most job descriptions list as a requirement for cloud engineering roles.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Azure track:</strong> AZ-104 (Azure Administrator). Cost $165. Tests identity, storage, compute, networking, and monitoring. Hands-on labs are required preparation.</li>
  <li><strong>AWS track:</strong> AWS SAA-C03 (Solutions Architect Associate). Cost $150. Tests secure, resilient, high-performing, and cost-optimised architectures.</li>
  <li><strong>Hands-on time:</strong> Budget at least 100 hours of real work in the cloud. Build a home lab, contribute to an employer project, or use free-tier accounts. Reading without building does not produce exam-ready skills.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Stage 3: specialisation (9-18 months)</h2>
<p>After the associate cert, the roadmap forks based on the role you are targeting.</p>

<h3>Infrastructure and platform engineering</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AZ-305 (Azure Solutions Architect Expert) or AWS SAP-C02 for architecture breadth</li>
  <li>Terraform Associate certification for Infrastructure as Code credibility</li>
  <li>CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) if your target role involves container platforms</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security engineering</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AZ-500 (Azure Security Engineer) or AWS Security Specialty</li>
  <li>CompTIA Security+ as a baseline if coming from a non-security background</li>
</ul>

<h3>FinOps and cloud financial management</h3>
<ul>
  <li>FinOps Certified Practitioner (FOCP) from the FinOps Foundation. Cost $300. Conceptual, 50 questions, 1 hour.</li>
  <li>Relevant for roles that own cloud spend, operate cost dashboards, or present cloud cost data to finance teams.</li>
</ul>

<h3>DevOps and automation</h3>
<ul>
  <li>AZ-400 (DevOps Engineer Expert) for Azure-specific CI/CD pipelines</li>
  <li>GitHub Actions, Terraform, and Ansible skills are expected in most platform roles regardless of cert</li>
</ul>

<h2>Skills that matter more than certs (but need certs to signal them)</h2>
<p>The cert gets you the interview. These skills get you the job:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Infrastructure as Code: Terraform or Bicep, not just portal clicking</li>
  <li>Monitoring and observability: Azure Monitor / CloudWatch, log querying with KQL or Athena</li>
  <li>Networking: VPN gateways, peering, network security groups, DNS resolution across VNets</li>
  <li>Identity and access management: RBAC, Entra ID (Azure AD), service principals, managed identities</li>
  <li>Scripting: Bash and PowerShell, enough to automate deployments and parse JSON output from CLI tools</li>
</ul>

<h2>Infrastructure as Code: start here</h2>
<pre><code># Terraform: initialise a new Azure project
terraform init

# Preview what will be created
terraform plan

# Deploy
terraform apply

# Bicep: deploy a resource group via Azure CLI
az deployment sub create \
  --location westeurope \
  --template-file main.bicep \
  --parameters @main.parameters.json
</code></pre>
<p>Every cloud engineering job description in 2026 lists Terraform or Bicep. If you can write a working module that deploys a VNet with subnets and NSGs, you are ahead of most candidates who only know the portal.</p>

<h2>How to structure 12 months</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Months 1-2: Foundation cert + core skills setup (Linux, networking, CLI tools)</li>
  <li>Months 3-6: Associate cert study + 100+ hours hands-on time</li>
  <li>Months 7-9: First job or role change using associate cert</li>
  <li>Months 10-12: Specialisation cert based on role (architecture, security, containers, or FinOps)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is aggressive but achievable. The engineers who compress this timeline do daily lab work and treat cert prep as a second job for 6-9 months. Consistency beats cramming every time.</p>

      },
      {
        q: "Is Kubernetes required for cloud engineering?",
        a: "Not for all cloud engineering roles. Kubernetes is expected in platform engineering, SRE, and DevOps roles. It is less required for pure infrastructure or security engineering positions.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need both AWS and Azure certifications?",
        a: "Not immediately. Get one cloud's associate cert first, get a job, then add the second cloud. Engineers with both associate-level certs are more hireable and earn more, but chasing both simultaneously slows your progress.",

<h2>Domain coverage</h2>
<p><strong>AWS SAA-C03</strong> covers four domains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design Secure Architectures (30%)</li>
  <li>Design Resilient Architectures (26%)</li>
  <li>Design High-Performing Architectures (24%)</li>
  <li>Design Cost-Optimised Architectures (20%)</li>
</ul>
<p>The exam is architecture-focused. Questions present a business scenario and ask you to choose the most appropriate AWS services and configuration. You need to know the nuances between EC2 instance types, S3 storage classes, RDS configurations, VPC design patterns, and IAM policies.</p>

<p><strong>AZ-104</strong> covers five domains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manage Azure Identities and Governance (15-20%)</li>
  <li>Implement and Manage Storage (15-20%)</li>
  <li>Deploy and Manage Azure Compute Resources (20-25%)</li>
  <li>Implement and Manage Virtual Networking (15-20%)</li>
  <li>Monitor and Maintain Azure Resources (10-15%)</li>
</ul>
<p>AZ-104 is administrator-focused. Questions test whether you can configure and manage specific Azure resources. You get interactive lab-style questions where you perform tasks in a simulated Azure portal.</p>

<h2>The key difference: architect vs administrator</h2>
<p>AWS SAA-C03 tests your ability to design solutions using AWS services. You are selecting the right tool for a given scenario. AZ-104 tests your ability to configure and manage Azure resources operationally. Both require hands-on familiarity, but the emphasis is different.</p>

<p>If your job involves deciding which cloud services to use, SAA-C03 maps better to your work. If your job involves deploying, configuring, and operating Azure resources daily, AZ-104 maps better.</p>

<h2>Study time and pass rates</h2>
<p>SAA-C03: Most candidates need 50-80 hours. Community-reported pass rates on first attempt are around 65-70%. Stephane Maarek's Udemy course is the most recommended resource by a significant margin based on r/AWSCertifications community data.</p>

<p>AZ-104: Most candidates need 60-80 hours including lab time. Candidates who complete all 11 official Microsoft lab exercises pass at higher rates than those who only study video courses. The interactive exam format rewards hands-on practice more than SAA-C03 does.</p>

<h2>Job market value</h2>
<p>In the Netherlands: AZ-104 is listed in more enterprise job descriptions than SAA-C03. The Netherlands is an Azure-heavy market due to Microsoft's strong enterprise presence and data centre availability in West Europe.</p>

<p>Globally: SAA-C03 is listed more frequently overall. AWS's larger market share means more raw job volume. SAA-C03 is listed as a requirement or preference in more job postings across the US and Asia-Pacific than AZ-104.</p>

<h2>Can you study for both at once?</h2>
<p>You can, but it is slower. The concepts overlap at about 40-50% (networking, identity, storage, compute fundamentals transfer between clouds). The service-specific knowledge is different and can confuse you during exam prep if you are switching between the two simultaneously. The standard recommendation is to get one cert, use it to get or advance in a job, then prepare for the second cert.</p>

<h2>Cross-cloud CLI comparison</h2>
<pre><code># AWS: list EC2 instances in a region
aws ec2 describe-instances \
  --query 'Reservations[].Instances[].{ID:InstanceId,State:State.Name,Type:InstanceType}' \
  --output table

# Azure: list VMs in a resource group
az vm list \
  --resource-group my-rg \
  --query "[].{name:name, size:hardwareProfile.vmSize, state:powerState}" \
  --output table
</code></pre>
<p>Running both CLIs side by side when you start your second cloud study is the fastest way to map familiar concepts to new syntax. The mental model transfers; the commands do not.</p>
    `,
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is AWS SAA-C03 or AZ-104 harder?",
        a: "They are roughly equivalent in difficulty, but different in style. SAA-C03 requires more architectural decision-making and service memorization. AZ-104 requires more hands-on configuration practice and tests you through interactive questions.",
      },
      {
        q: "Which cert pays more: AWS SAA-C03 or AZ-104?",

        q: "How long does AWS SAA-C03 take to study for?",

<p>These are not competing certs. A FinOps Foundation certification and a Google Cloud certification test different skills, target different roles, and serve different career purposes. Comparing them makes sense only if you are deciding where to invest your study time next.</p>

<h2>What each cert actually tests</h2>
<p>The FinOps Certified Practitioner (FOCP) tests your understanding of cloud financial management as a practice. It is vendor-neutral. The exam covers the FinOps lifecycle (Inform, Optimize, Operate), the principles of FinOps, and the personas who operate within a FinOps practice (finance, engineering, leadership). Cost: <strong>$300 USD</strong> via <a href="https://learn.finops.org/finops-certified-practitioner-certification-exam" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learn.finops.org</a>. 50 questions, 1 hour, unproctored.</p>

<p>Google Cloud Professional certifications test hands-on technical skills on Google Cloud Platform. The Professional Cloud Architect is the most recognised. Cost: <strong>$200 USD</strong> via <a href="https://cloud.google.com/learn/certification/cloud-architect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud</a>. It is a 2-hour exam with scenario-based questions and two case studies. You need 3+ years of industry experience and 1+ year managing Google Cloud solutions.</p>

<h2>Career trajectories</h2>
<p>The FOCP opens doors to cloud financial management roles: FinOps analyst, cloud cost optimisation engineer, cloud economics lead. These roles are growing as organisations realise they are spending more on cloud than budgeted. The FinOps Foundation reports significant growth in FinOps practice adoption; the FOCP signals to employers that you understand the practice, not just the tooling.</p>

<p>Google Cloud Professional certifications signal technical depth on GCP specifically. Google Cloud's market share is around 10-12% globally, which means GCP-specific roles are less numerous than AWS or Azure roles. However, GCP dominates in specific sectors: data and analytics (BigQuery, Vertex AI), media and gaming, and some government deployments. If your target employer or sector is GCP-heavy, the Professional Cloud Architect is worth the study investment.</p>

<h2>Study time comparison</h2>
<p>FOCP: 2-3 weeks of part-time study reading the FinOps Framework documentation and completing the course materials on learn.finops.org. No hands-on lab required.</p>

<p>Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect: 3-6 months for candidates new to GCP, assuming 10-15 hours of study per week. The exam includes two case studies (Mountkirk Games and Dress4Win are the published examples) that require deep scenario analysis. Hands-on time on GCP is required.</p>

<h2>Which one first?</h2>
<p>If you work across multiple cloud providers and finance is a significant part of your responsibilities: FOCP first. It applies to all clouds and requires less study time.</p>

<p>If you work primarily on GCP and want to advance technically: Google Cloud Professional Cloud Architect, starting with the Associate Cloud Engineer if you are not already familiar with GCP.</p>

<p>If neither cloud is your primary platform and you want a cert for a new job: look at the job descriptions for roles you are targeting and match your cert to what those descriptions ask for. Do not study for a cert that no job you want actually mentions.</p>

<h2>GCP cost visibility check</h2>
<pre><code># List GCP projects and their billing accounts
gcloud projects list --format="table(projectId, name, projectNumber)"

# Check current billing for a project
gcloud billing projects describe PROJECT_ID

# List resource usage in a BigQuery billing export (standard FinOps task)
# Run in BigQuery console:
-- SELECT service.description, SUM(cost) as total_cost
-- FROM \`billing_dataset.gcp_billing_export\`
-- WHERE DATE(usage_start_time) >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
-- GROUP BY service.description
-- ORDER BY total_cost DESC;
</code></pre>
<p>A real FinOps practitioner working with GCP uses BigQuery exports for cost analysis. This is the kind of task the FOCP assumes you understand conceptually, and the GCP Professional cert assumes you can execute technically.</p>

    content: `
<p>AZ-305 is harder than AZ-104. That is the honest answer. The question is by how much, and whether the difficulty is the kind that rewards the study you have already done or requires a different approach entirely.</p>

<h2>The prerequisite relationship</h2>
<p>AZ-305 has a formal prerequisite: you must hold the Microsoft Certified: Azure Administrator Associate certification (earned by passing AZ-104) before you can earn the Azure Solutions Architect Expert credential. You can sit the AZ-305 exam without holding AZ-104, but you cannot claim the Expert certification until you have passed both.</p>
<p>Cost: Both exams cost <strong>$165 USD</strong> each via <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/credentials/certifications/azure-solutions-architect/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pearson VUE</a>. Earning the Expert certification requires passing AZ-104 + AZ-305, so budget $330 in exam fees at minimum.</p>

<h2>Domain comparison</h2>
<p><strong>AZ-104</strong> tests operational configuration across five domains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Manage Azure Identities and Governance (15-20%)</li>
  <li>Implement and Manage Storage (15-20%)</li>
  <li>Deploy and Manage Azure Compute Resources (20-25%)</li>
  <li>Implement and Manage Virtual Networking (15-20%)</li>
  <li>Monitor and Maintain Azure Resources (10-15%)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AZ-305</strong> tests architectural design across four domains:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Design Identity, Governance, and Monitoring Solutions (25-30%)</li>
  <li>Design Data Storage Solutions (25-30%)</li>
  <li>Design Business Continuity Solutions (10-15%)</li>
  <li>Design Infrastructure Solutions (25-30%)</li>
</ul>

<h2>The fundamental difference in what each exam tests</h2>
<p>AZ-104 asks: "How do you configure this?" You get a task and you need to know the correct CLI command, the portal setting, or the correct policy assignment. Questions have a right answer and a wrong answer.</p>

<p>AZ-305 asks: "Given these constraints, which design is best and why?" Questions present a scenario with business requirements (cost target, compliance obligation, availability SLA) and ask you to select the most appropriate architecture. The challenge is that multiple options are plausible, and you need to identify which trade-offs the question is actually testing.</p>

<p>This is a fundamentally different cognitive skill. Many people who score well on AZ-104 underestimate AZ-305 because they expect the same kind of "do I know the right command" pattern. AZ-305 requires you to reason about trade-offs, not recall configuration details.</p>

<h2>Difficulty by the numbers</h2>
<p>Community-reported data from r/AzureCertifications suggests first-attempt pass rates of 70-75% for AZ-104 and 60-65% for AZ-305 among candidates who have done structured preparation. The gap widens for candidates who do not complete case study practice before sitting AZ-305.</p>

<h2>What you need to know for AZ-305 that AZ-104 does not prepare you for</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Azure Well-Architected Framework.</strong> AZ-305 questions reference the five pillars (Reliability, Security, Cost Optimization, Operational Excellence, Performance Efficiency) and expect you to apply them to design choices.</li>
  <li><strong>Data storage design.</strong> Cosmos DB consistency levels, Azure SQL vs Synapse Analytics vs Azure Data Lake trade-offs, storage redundancy patterns for compliance requirements.</li>
  <li><strong>Business continuity architecture.</strong> RTO/RPO requirements mapped to specific Azure backup and disaster recovery configurations (Azure Site Recovery, backup vaults, geo-redundant storage).</li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid and multi-region design.</strong> ExpressRoute vs VPN Gateway trade-offs, Azure Front Door vs Traffic Manager, designing for latency vs cost vs availability.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Study resources for AZ-305</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/microsoft-azure-architect-design-prerequisites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft Learn paths for AZ-305</a> are the starting point. John Savill's Azure Master Class on YouTube provides architecture-level explanations that map well to the AZ-305 question style. Case study practice is non-negotiable: download the official exam case studies from Microsoft Learn and practice structuring your reasoning before you sit the exam.</p>

<h2>Study time estimate</h2>
<p>Candidates who passed AZ-104 within the last 6 months typically need 40-60 hours of dedicated AZ-305 preparation. Candidates who earned AZ-104 more than a year ago and have not been doing hands-on architecture work should budget 80+ hours and refresh their AZ-104 knowledge before starting.</p>

<h2>Architecture decision example</h2>
<pre><code># AZ-305 tests decisions like this one:
# Bicep snippet for a geo-redundant storage account
# (Understanding when to choose this over LRS or ZRS is an AZ-305 topic)

resource storageAccount 'Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts@2023-01-01' = {
  name: 'stproddatawe001'
  location: 'westeurope'
  kind: 'StorageV2'
  sku: {
    name: 'Standard_RAGRS'  // Read-access geo-redundant. AZ-305 tests WHY you choose RAGRS vs GRS vs ZRS
  }
  properties: {
    minimumTlsVersion: 'TLS1_2'
    allowBlobPublicAccess: false
    supportsHttpsTrafficOnly: true
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>AZ-104 tests whether you can deploy a storage account. AZ-305 tests whether you know when to use <code>Standard_RAGRS</code> vs <code>Standard_ZRS</code> vs <code>Standard_GRS</code> given a specific RPO and compliance requirement. Study the trade-offs, not just the syntax.</p>

        q: "How long does it take to prepare for AZ-305?",

    content: `
<p>Most sites that appear at the top of search results for "free AWS practice exams" are not actually free. They give you 10-15 questions at no cost, then require a purchase. This list covers what is genuinely free, what is partially free, and what the paid options are worth.</p>

<h2>Genuinely free resources</h2>

<h3>AWS Skill Builder (official, free tier)</h3>
<p>AWS offers a free tier on <a href="https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS Skill Builder</a> that includes official practice question sets for most certifications. The free Official Practice Question Sets are short (20-30 questions) but are authored by the same team that writes the real exam. The question style, difficulty, and explanation quality are the most reliable free resource available.</p>
<p>What is free: Official Practice Question Sets, digital courses, and learning plans for most certifications.</p>
<p>What requires the paid subscription ($29/month): Official Practice Exams (full-length, 65 questions, timed) and the Exam Prep Enhanced courses.</p>

<h3>ExamTopics community questions</h3>
<p>ExamTopics has community-contributed questions for most AWS certifications. These are not official, and some answers are disputed in the comments. However, the volume of questions is large and the community discussions often clarify the reasoning behind correct answers. For SAA-C03, the question bank is extensive.</p>
<p>Caution: Some questions are outdated or incorrect. Always verify answers against the <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS documentation</a> when in doubt. Do not treat ExamTopics as your primary study source.</p>

<h3>AWS free practice assessments</h3>
<p>For some certifications, AWS provides a free 20-question practice assessment directly on the certification page at aws.amazon.com. Check the specific certification page for the exam you are targeting.</p>

<h3>r/AWSCertifications community resources</h3>
<p>The AWSCertifications subreddit maintains a wiki with links to free study resources, including community-contributed practice questions and study guides. The "passed today" posts often include the specific resources that worked for that candidate.</p>

<h2>Partially free (limited without account)</h2>

<h3>Tutorials Dojo (Jon Bonso)</h3>
<p>Tutorials Dojo practice exams are considered the gold standard by the AWS certification community. They are not free, but they offer a limited number of free questions. The full practice exam sets cost around $15-20 each and are widely recommended. The explanations are thorough and include references to official AWS documentation.</p>
<p>For SAA-C03: the Tutorials Dojo practice exam set is the most commonly recommended purchase among candidates who passed on their first attempt.</p>

<h3>Whizlabs</h3>
<p>Whizlabs offers 15-20 free questions per exam and paid full practice exams. The quality is acceptable but below Tutorials Dojo for most AWS exams based on community feedback.</p>

<h2>How to use practice exams effectively</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Do not start practice exams until you have covered the exam content. Practice exams reveal gaps; they do not fill them.</li>
  <li>Review every wrong answer against the official AWS documentation. Not against other practice exam explanations, against the source docs.</li>
  <li>If you are getting below 65% on practice exams after studying, you need more content coverage, not more practice exams.</li>
  <li>If you are consistently getting 80%+ on practice exams, book your real exam. Over-preparing with practice questions creates false confidence in specific questions rather than real understanding.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The free study plan for AWS SAA-C03</h2>
<p>This is achievable at zero cost beyond the $150 exam fee:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Week 1-2:</strong> Stephane Maarek's SAA-C03 course on Udemy (frequently on sale for $10-15). Not free, but the most recommended paid course.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 3-4:</strong> Adrian Cantrill's free SAA-C03 demos on GitHub/YouTube for hands-on context.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 5:</strong> Official Practice Question Sets on AWS Skill Builder (free tier). All incorrect answers reviewed against AWS docs.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 6:</strong> ExamTopics community questions, cross-referencing disputed answers with AWS documentation.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Check your AWS exam readiness</h2>
<pre><code># Confirm your AWS CLI is configured correctly before labs
aws sts get-caller-identity

# List available practice exams on Skill Builder (requires browser)
# Direct URL: https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn/catalog?ct=ft&amp;search=practice+exam

# Check your current certification status
aws certification get-candidate-summary
# Note: this command requires the AWS Certification CLI, not standard AWS CLI
</code></pre>

<h2>Is paying for practice exams worth it?</h2>
<p>For SAA-C03: yes. The Tutorials Dojo set at $15-20 is the most cost-effective exam prep investment after your study course. The pass rate correlation is strong enough that the community consistently recommends it. A $20 purchase on a practice exam is cheaper than a $150 retake.</p>
<p>For simpler exams like AWS Cloud Practitioner (CLF-C02): the free official practice question set from AWS Skill Builder is probably sufficient if you have done a full course.</p>

      {
        q: "What is the best free resource for AWS SAA-C03 practice?",

      },
      {
        q: "How many practice exams should I do before the real AWS exam?",
        a: "Two to three full-length practice exams is the standard recommendation. Focus on reviewing every wrong answer against official documentation. More practice exams without deep review of wrong answers is less effective than fewer exams with thorough follow-up.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is Tutorials Dojo worth buying for AWS practice exams?",
        a: "Yes, for SAA-C03 and other associate-level exams. The Tutorials Dojo practice exam sets cost $15-20 each and are consistently recommended by candidates who passed on their first attempt. The explanations reference official AWS documentation and are well-maintained.",

<p>The honest answer to "how much does an AWS SAA-C03 holder earn" is that the cert itself is worth roughly nothing in isolation. What it does is open the door to roles where the salary is set by years of experience, the company you work for, and the city you sit in. The cert gets you to the interview. Below are the numbers you can actually expect once you are in.</p>

<h2>Headline numbers (United States, all experience levels)</h2>
<p>Glassdoor data pulled in March 2026 from 268 anonymous reports lists the average total compensation for AWS Solutions Architect at $176,034 per year, with the 25th percentile at $144,806 and the 75th percentile at $216,408. The 90th percentile sits at $259,486. These figures are total comp (base plus bonus plus stock), not base salary.</p>
<p>Levels.fyi, which skews toward higher-paying tech employers, reports a median total comp of $215,000 for "Solutions Architect" titles in the US for 2025-2026 data, with FAANG-tier offers landing between $280,000 and $420,000 at L5/E5 equivalents.</p>
<p>The Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025 puts cloud-focused engineers in the US at a median salary of $156,000 base, lower than Glassdoor because the survey captures base only and includes a wider distribution of company types.</p>

</table>
<p>The US West premium is real: Bay Area total comp at the senior level can run double the equivalent role in Berlin or Amsterdam, and that gap shows no signs of closing in 2026.</p>

<h2>By company tier</h2>
<h3>FAANG and equivalent (Meta, Google, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Netflix)</h3>
<p>Solutions architects at these companies are typically internal customer-facing roles or pre-sales positions. L4 (mid-level) total comp ranges from $200,000 to $280,000 in the US per Levels.fyi 2025-2026 data. L5 (senior) ranges from $300,000 to $450,000. Stock vesting is the dominant component above L4.</p>

<h3>Unicorns and late-stage startups (Stripe, Databricks, Snowflake, Datadog)</h3>
<p>Mid-level: $170,000-$230,000 total comp. Senior: $240,000-$340,000. Equity is illiquid until IPO, so the headline numbers can mislead. The cash component is typically $140,000-$190,000 base for senior roles.</p>

<h3>Consultancies (Accenture, Deloitte, Capgemini, Slalom)</h3>
<p>The consultancy market values certs more directly than product companies because partner status with AWS depends on certified headcount. Mid-level base salary in the US: $115,000-$145,000. Senior: $145,000-$185,000. Bonuses are smaller (10-15%) and stock is usually nil. The trade is steady salary growth and constant exposure to new clients.</p>

<h3>Enterprise (banks, retailers, healthcare, government)</h3>
<p>Mid-level: $110,000-$140,000 base. Senior: $140,000-$180,000. Bonuses 10-20%. Pace is slower, scope is narrower, but the work-life balance is significantly better than at consultancies or unicorns.</p>

<h2>What the cert is actually worth</h2>
<p>The honest take, after watching hundreds of engineers progress through AWS certs over the last six years: the SAA-C03 has high signal value for the first 3-5 years of your career. After that, the signal decays sharply. Hiring managers care about what you have built and operated, not which exam you passed in 2024.</p>
<p>The cert gets you into interview pipelines that filter on credentials. Once you are in the room, your salary is set by your ability to talk through a real architecture you designed, the failure modes you have debugged in production, and the trade-offs you can articulate. Engineers at the 5+ YoE mark who lean on the cert as their main credential tend to earn 10-20% less than peers who lead with their project portfolio.</p>
<p>One concrete pattern: SAA-C03 holders with strong production AWS experience in their resume (specific services, scale numbers, business impact) get 20-30% higher offer rates than those who list the cert prominently but generic project descriptions. The cert is a checkbox, not a story.</p>

<h2>Salary delta from holding SAA-C03</h2>
<p>Controlling for experience and location, the SAA-C03 alone correlates with roughly a 5-10% salary uplift in 2025-2026 hiring data from the Dice Tech Salary Report. That is meaningful for early-career engineers, marginal for mid-career, and statistically noisy for senior roles. Adding a professional cert (SAP-C02) on top correlates with another 5-8%. Adding a specialty cert correlates with 3-5%.</p>
<p>The strongest salary signal is not the cert itself but the production experience that earns it. Engineers who pass SAA-C03 after a year of hands-on AWS work consistently outperform those who pass it via study courses without job experience, both in interview success rate and in starting salary.</p>

<h2>What pays more than the cert</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Live production experience operating at scale (TB/PB data, MM users, multi-region)</li>
  <li>Specialised domain knowledge (FinOps, security, ML platform engineering)</li>
  <li>The ability to lead an architecture review and write a clear design doc</li>
  <li>A track record of cost optimisation with hard numbers attached</li>
  <li>Open source contributions to AWS-adjacent tooling (Terraform providers, AWS CDK constructs, kubectl plugins)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Practical next steps</h2>
<p>If your goal is salary growth, treat the SAA-C03 as table stakes for a cloud engineering role and invest the next 12 months in production work that creates a portfolio. The compounding effect of two years of real AWS experience is larger than any combination of additional certs.</p>
<p>If you want structured progression, the natural cert ladder is SAA-C03, then either SAP-C02 (Solutions Architect Professional) for breadth or DOP-C02 (DevOps Engineer Professional) for depth. The professional certs correlate with stronger salary uplift in senior roles than stacking more associate certs.</p>

<h2>CLI: a one-liner to estimate AWS spend visibility, the kind of work that pays</h2>
<pre><code># Pull this month's spend grouped by service to demonstrate cost awareness in interviews
aws ce get-cost-and-usage \\
  --time-period Start=$(date +%Y-%m-01),End=$(date +%Y-%m-%d) \\
  --granularity MONTHLY \\
  --metrics "UnblendedCost" \\
  --group-by Type=DIMENSION,Key=SERVICE \\
  --output table
</code></pre>
<p>Engineers who can speak fluently about cost data, not just architecture diagrams, command higher offers. The CLI command above is the kind of muscle memory that signals real production fluency.</p>

<p>AZ-104 is the cert that hiring managers actually check for when filling Azure operations and platform roles. Below are the numbers you can expect once you have it, broken down by region, years of experience, and the type of employer paying the salary.</p>

<h2>Headline numbers (United States)</h2>
<p>Glassdoor data from April 2026 reports an average Azure Administrator salary of $163,282 per year in the US, with a 25th to 75th percentile range of $129,689 to $208,270. ZipRecruiter data from May 2026, which captures more job-board listings versus self-reported tech salaries, sits lower at an average of $88,927 per year with a 25th-75th range of $70,000 to $104,000. The gap between these two sources reflects the difference between total compensation in tech-heavy companies (Glassdoor) and base salary in broader enterprise listings (ZipRecruiter).</p>
<p>The Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2025 puts DevOps and SysAdmin roles in the US at a median of $122,000 base, which is the closest broad benchmark for AZ-104 holders not at FAANG-tier employers.</p>

<h2>By company tier</h2>
<h3>Microsoft and partner ecosystem</h3>
<p>Microsoft itself, plus partners like Avanade and Insight, run heavily on Azure. Levels.fyi 2026 data lists Microsoft 60 (mid-level) total comp at $190,000-$240,000, Microsoft 63 (senior) at $260,000-$340,000. Avanade pays roughly 70-80% of Microsoft direct numbers but has steady consulting work and clear progression.</p>

<h3>EU consultancy premium</h3>
<p>This is where AZ-104 holds its strongest market value. Avanade, Accenture, EPAM, Capgemini, and Sopra Steria run large Azure migration practices in the EU and reward AZ-104 holders directly. Mid-level Azure consultants at these firms in the Netherlands or Germany earn EUR 65,000-85,000 base plus 8-15% bonus. Senior consultants reach EUR 90,000-115,000. The reason: partner status with Microsoft requires a minimum count of certified consultants, so each AZ-104 holder is worth a measurable amount to the partner's revenue model.</p>
<p>In Belgium and France, the same firms pay slightly less in base (EUR 55,000-75,000 mid-level) but offer larger company-car benefits that effectively close the gap.</p>

<h3>US enterprise (banks, healthcare, retail)</h3>
<p>Mid-level Azure admin: $95,000-$130,000 base. Senior: $135,000-$170,000. Bonuses 8-15%. Stock options usually limited to RSUs at public companies. The market here is dominated by hybrid cloud roles where AZ-104 plus on-prem Windows Server admin experience commands the strongest premium.</p>

<h3>FAANG-equivalent (when they run Azure workloads)</h3>
<p>Microsoft, LinkedIn, GitHub, and OpenAI run on Azure. Adobe, ServiceNow, and Salesforce run multi-cloud with significant Azure footprints. Total comp follows the company's standard bands, not the cert. L60 mid-level $200,000-$260,000, L63 senior $280,000-$380,000 per Levels.fyi 2026.</p>

<h3>Government and public sector</h3>
<p>US federal contractors pay $115,000-$155,000 mid-level for AZ-104 plus US clearance (Secret or higher). UK public sector and civil service roles pay GBP 50,000-75,000 mid-level. EU public sector tends to pay 10-20% below private market but offers strong job security and pension benefits.</p>

<h2>What changes the salary number most</h2>
<p>Per the Dice Tech Salary Report 2025-2026, the strongest salary correlates for AZ-104 holders are, in order:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Years of total IT experience (10+ vs 0-2 adds roughly 2-2.5x base)</li>
  <li>City and country (Bay Area vs Midwest US: 1.5-1.8x; Amsterdam vs Bucharest: 2.5-3x)</li>
  <li>Combined cert stack (AZ-104 + AZ-305 + AZ-500 holders earn 15-25% more than AZ-104 only)</li>
  <li>IaC fluency (Terraform or Bicep production experience adds 8-12%)</li>
  <li>Hybrid identity skills (Entra ID, AD Connect, federation) adds 5-10% in enterprise roles</li>
</ol>

<h2>The cert is the floor, not the ceiling</h2>
<p>An engineer with five years of Azure operations experience and an expired AZ-104 will out-earn an engineer with a fresh AZ-104 and no production experience by a wide margin. The cert is a hiring filter and a renewal trigger, not a salary determinant on its own.</p>
<p>What pays measurably more: a track record of running production Azure environments at scale, specifically migrations completed, cost reductions delivered with hard numbers, incident response leadership, and the ability to write a credible architecture decision record. These are the items hiring managers actually probe in interviews. AZ-104 just gets you to the room.</p>

<h2>The Microsoft renewal model and what it means for salary</h2>
<p>Microsoft moved to free annual renewal via online assessment in 2026. The cost of keeping AZ-104 active is now zero in dollars and roughly 45-90 minutes per year in time. This effectively removes the "cert maintenance overhead" argument from salary negotiations: hiring managers no longer treat the cert as a one-time achievement that decays in 18 months. Engineers should keep their renewal current and treat it as background hygiene.</p>

<h2>What to do with this information</h2>
<p>If you are early in your career: AZ-104 plus 18 months of hands-on Azure work in a real environment is the baseline that lets you negotiate against the salary bands above. Pair it with Terraform or Bicep fluency and you are above the median for your YoE.</p>
<p>If you are mid-career: AZ-104 alone is no longer differentiating. Pair it with AZ-305 or AZ-500 and a specialisation (network, security, or platform) to push into the senior bands.</p>
<p>If you are senior: keep AZ-104 renewed, but invest your study time in expert-level certs or adjacent skills (Kubernetes, FinOps, multi-cloud) where the marginal salary uplift is higher than another Microsoft associate cert.</p>

<p>The cloud architect title gets thrown around. In practice it covers four distinct seniority bands with very different scopes, decision authority, and pay. This is the actual progression as it plays out at most companies in 2026, with the cert recommendations and pay bands that match each stage.</p>

<h2>Stage 1: cloud engineer (1-3 years)</h2>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong> You build and operate the things other people designed. Day-to-day means writing Terraform modules, configuring monitoring, debugging deployments, responding to alerts, and shipping infrastructure changes that someone else reviewed.</p>
<p><strong>Decision authority:</strong> Service-level. You decide which AWS instance type to use, how to structure a Terraform module, how to wire up a logging pipeline. You do not decide which cloud the company runs on or how the platform team is structured.</p>
<p><strong>Technical depth vs breadth:</strong> Heavy depth on a small set of services. You know AWS Lambda, S3, IAM, and your monitoring stack better than anyone. You have surface familiarity with everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended certs:</strong> AWS SAA-C03 or AZ-104 as the baseline. Add Terraform Associate after 12 months on the job.</p>
<p><strong>Pay band (US, total comp):</strong> $95,000-$140,000. Glassdoor 2026 reports a junior cloud engineer median of $113,000. Source: Glassdoor 2026, Levels.fyi 2025-2026.</p>

<h2>Stage 2: senior cloud engineer (3-6 years)</h2>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong> You own a service or a system. You design new components, lead the implementation, and are the person on-call who knows where the bodies are buried. You start mentoring juniors and reviewing their PRs.</p>
<p><strong>Decision authority:</strong> System-level. You decide how a multi-service platform fits together, how data flows between services, how to handle failure modes. You influence platform direction but do not set it.</p>
<p><strong>Technical depth vs breadth:</strong> Deeper on more services. You can run a system end to end and explain trade-offs. You start having opinions about cross-cutting concerns: cost, reliability, security posture.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended certs:</strong> Professional-tier or expert-tier in your primary cloud. SAP-C02, AZ-305, or Google Cloud Professional Architect. Specialty certs in your domain (Security, Networking, Database).</p>
<p><strong>Pay band (US, total comp):</strong> $140,000-$210,000. Glassdoor 2026 lists senior cloud engineer median at $169,626. Levels.fyi puts the senior band at FAANG between $200,000 and $290,000. Source: Glassdoor 2026, Levels.fyi 2025-2026.</p>

<h2>Stage 3: staff engineer or solutions architect (6-10 years)</h2>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong> You design platforms, not services. You write architecture decision records, run RFC reviews, and influence multiple teams. Solutions architect is the customer-facing variant; staff engineer is the internal-platform variant.</p>
<p><strong>Decision authority:</strong> Cross-team. You set platform direction, choose the cloud strategy for a domain, decide build-vs-buy questions. You partner with product and engineering leadership to set technical roadmaps.</p>
<p><strong>Technical depth vs breadth:</strong> The shift to breadth is measurable here. You give up some depth in any single technology in exchange for fluency across a wider stack. You spend more time in design reviews and less time writing code, but you still need to be able to write code well enough that engineers respect your designs.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended certs:</strong> Beyond this stage, additional certs are mostly noise unless you are switching cloud focus. Conference talks, public writing, and open-source contributions matter more than another cert.</p>
<p><strong>Pay band (US, total comp):</strong> $200,000-$350,000. The single largest jump in the cloud engineering career path is senior to staff: Levels.fyi data shows a typical $30,000-$50,000 base salary increase plus a much larger stock component. Source: Levels.fyi 2025-2026, Pragmatic Engineer 2025 staff-eng compensation report.</p>

<h2>Stage 4: principal architect or distinguished engineer (10+ years)</h2>
<p><strong>Scope:</strong> You shape the company's technical direction across multiple platforms or business units. You partner with the CTO or VP Engineering on strategic decisions. You are the technical face of the engineering org for major customer or partner conversations.</p>
<p><strong>Decision authority:</strong> Org-level. You influence hiring, M&A technical due diligence, multi-year cloud strategy. Your decisions affect hundreds of engineers and tens of millions in spend.</p>
<p><strong>Technical depth vs breadth:</strong> Selectively deep, broadly fluent. You stay deep in one or two areas you actively own. Everywhere else, you are deep enough to ask the right questions and call out weak reasoning.</p>
<p><strong>Recommended certs:</strong> Maintain expert-tier certs for credibility with customers and partners. New certs at this level are rare and usually tied to a specific business need, not personal progression.</p>
<p><strong>Pay band (US, total comp):</strong> $300,000-$700,000+. Glassdoor 2026 lists principal cloud architect median at $253,920. Levels.fyi data for FAANG L7-L8 ranges from $500,000 to $1,200,000 with significant stock weighting. Source: Glassdoor 2026, Levels.fyi 2025-2026.</p>

<h2>What gets you promoted at each transition</h2>
<h3>Engineer to senior</h3>
<p>You demonstrate that you can own a system, debug it under pressure, and ship reliable changes without supervision. The signal is technical: shipped projects, on-call performance, code review quality.</p>

<h3>Senior to staff</h3>
<p>You demonstrate scope outside your immediate team. The signal is influence: you wrote a design doc that changed how three teams work, you led an incident review that produced platform-wide improvements, you mentored someone who got promoted. Many engineers stall here because they double down on technical depth instead of building cross-team scope.</p>

<h3>Staff to principal</h3>
<p>You demonstrate strategic technical judgment. The signal is direction: you proposed and led a multi-year initiative, you represented engineering in a customer or executive context, your decisions saved or generated measurable revenue. The pyramid narrows sharply here. Most companies have one or two principals per several hundred engineers.</p>

<h2>The path is not linear</h2>
<p>Some engineers stay at staff level for their entire career and earn excellent compensation without ever pursuing principal. Some move from staff IC to engineering management and back. Some pivot from product engineering to platform architecture. The career ladder above is the most common path; it is not the only one. The honest filter is whether each stage's day-to-day work appeals to you, not whether the title chart says you should be at a certain level by a certain age.</p>

<p>Cert renewal is overhead. Once you hold three or four cloud certs, the calendar of renewals starts eating real time. The question is which ones are worth maintaining and which ones to let lapse when you change roles. Below is the renewal model for each major cert family in 2026, plus a practical strategy.</p>

<h2>AWS renewal model</h2>
<p>AWS associate certs (SAA-C03, DVA-C02, SOA-C02) are valid for 3 years. Renewal options:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pass the next exam in the same path (SAA-C03 holders can renew by passing SAP-C02 Professional). This resets the clock on both the associate and the professional.</li>
  <li>Re-sit the same exam at full cost ($150 for associate, $300 for professional).</li>
</ul>
<p>AWS professional certs (SAP-C02, DOP-C02) are also valid for 3 years. Renewal is by re-sitting the same exam at $300, or by passing a more advanced specialty cert. AWS specialty certs are 3 years, $300 each.</p>
<p><strong>Free renewal path:</strong> none in the AWS ecosystem. AWS does not offer free online assessments. Every renewal costs money or requires passing a higher-tier exam.</p>

<h2>Azure (Microsoft) renewal model</h2>
<p>Microsoft moved to a unified annual renewal model in 2026. All role-based and specialty certs (AZ-104, AZ-305, AZ-500, AZ-700, SC-100, MS-102, etc.) are valid for 1 year. Renewal is via free online assessment on Microsoft Learn:</p>
<ul>
  <li>30-50 questions, 45-90 minutes, open book</li>
  <li>Free, unproctored, repeatable until you pass</li>
  <li>Six-month eligibility window before expiration</li>
</ul>
<p>Fundamentals certs (AZ-900, AI-900, DP-900) do not expire. Source: Microsoft Learn certification renewal documentation, accessed May 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Practical impact:</strong> Annual renewal sounds aggressive but takes about 60 minutes per cert per year. The cost is zero. There is no reason to let an active Azure cert lapse if you are still using the technology.</p>

<h2>Google Cloud renewal model</h2>
<p>Google Cloud Professional certs (Cloud Architect, Data Engineer, DevOps Engineer, Cloud Developer, Network Engineer, Security Engineer) are valid for 2 years. Associate Cloud Engineer is also 2 years. Renewal is by re-sitting the full exam at the original cost ($200 associate, $200 professional). Google does not offer a renewal-by-assessment option as of May 2026.</p>
<p><strong>Practical impact:</strong> Google's renewal model is the most demanding of the three major clouds. Plan for 30-40 hours of refresh study and a full proctored exam every 2 years.</p>

<h2>Linux Foundation (CKA, CKAD, CKS, KCNA)</h2>
<p>Linux Foundation Kubernetes certs are valid for 2 years (this changed from 3 years in early 2025). Renewal is by re-sitting the same exam at the current price. CKA is currently $445. There is no free renewal path.</p>
<p><strong>Practical impact:</strong> Kubernetes evolves quickly. The 2-year cycle aligns with roughly 4 minor version bumps. Renewal is genuinely useful study, not a paper exercise.</p>

<h2>FinOps Foundation (FOCP, FOCP-P)</h2>
<p>FOCP is valid for 2 years. Renewal is via continuing education credits earned through FinOps Foundation events, training, or community contributions, with a smaller fee than the original exam. FOCP-P (Professional) follows the same model.</p>

<h2>Renewal calendar template</h2>
<p>Build this as a spreadsheet or calendar. The structure is what matters: renewal dates by cert, cost, and time required.</p>

<h2>Which renewals to skip when you change roles</h2>
<p>The honest answer: any cert that is no longer in your daily work and is not on any near-term job description you would pursue. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>You moved from AWS to Azure:</strong> let the AWS associate certs lapse. Renew the AWS Pro only if your job market still values it. Azure renewals are free and worth maintaining.</li>
  <li><strong>You moved from infrastructure to security:</strong> renew SC-100 and AZ-500 free; let AZ-104 lapse if you are no longer doing operations.</li>
  <li><strong>You moved into engineering management:</strong> renew the most senior cert in your current cloud as a credibility signal. Let the rest lapse.</li>
  <li><strong>You moved from cloud engineering to platform engineering:</strong> renew CKA. Let GCP ACE lapse if you do not work with GCP.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The compounding cost of over-certification</h2>
<p>Engineers who hold 8+ active certs spend 80-160 hours per year on renewals. That time has an opportunity cost: a single side project shipped to GitHub, a conference talk, or a deep technical blog post often produces more career value than a renewed associate cert. Calculate the hours you spend on renewals annually and compare against alternatives.</p>

<h2>Practical strategy</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Identify your "active" cloud.</strong> The one you work with daily. Maintain its full cert stack at every level you have earned.</li>
  <li><strong>Identify your "secondary" cloud.</strong> The one you might use again. Maintain only the highest-tier cert you hold; let associates lapse.</li>
  <li><strong>Drop everything else.</strong> Certs from previous roles you do not anticipate returning to are pure overhead.</li>
  <li><strong>Default to keeping anything Microsoft.</strong> Free annual renewal removes the maintenance argument; only drop it if the cert is genuinely irrelevant to your current and near-future work.</li>
</ol>

<h2>What to put in your calendar</h2>
<p>For each active cert, set three reminders: 90 days before expiration (start prep), 30 days before (book exam or assessment), and 7 days before (final block in calendar). The 90-day window is the difference between casually maintaining a cert and panic-cramming the week before expiration.</p>
<pre><code># Example: track cert expirations in a flat file your shell can grep
# ~/.cert-calendar
SAA-C03  2027-08-12  150  AWS
AZ-104   2027-03-04  0    MS
AZ-305   2027-04-22  0    MS
CKA      2027-11-30  445  CNCF
</code></pre>
<p>The discipline is what matters, not the tool. A spreadsheet, a flat file, or a calendar app all work. What does not work: assuming you will remember.</p>

<p>If you are a software engineer moving into platform or DevOps work, the cert sequence below is the one that maps cleanly to the skills you will actually use. Skipping a step is fine if you have direct production experience in that area; the order matters because each cert assumes the prior layer.</p>

<h2>The full sequence at a glance</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Linux foundation (LFCS or equivalent self-study)</li>
  <li>Docker and Kubernetes fundamentals (KCNA optional)</li>
  <li>CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)</li>
  <li>One cloud associate cert (AWS SAA-C03 or AZ-104)</li>
  <li>HashiCorp Terraform Associate</li>
  <li>AWS DevOps Engineer Professional (DOP-C02) or Azure DevOps Engineer Expert (AZ-400)</li>
</ol>
<p>Total time investment for a software engineer with no prior ops experience: 12-18 months of consistent evening study plus production work. For an engineer already shipping infrastructure code at work, 6-9 months.</p>

<h2>Step 1: Linux foundation (4-6 weeks)</h2>
<p>You cannot do platform engineering without comfort on the Linux command line. The bar: you can write a non-trivial bash script, debug a systemd service, read journalctl output, troubleshoot file permissions, configure SSH and sudo, and operate at the shell without StackOverflow open.</p>
<p>Cert option: <strong>Linux Foundation Certified System Administrator (LFCS)</strong>, $395, performance-based 2-hour exam. Most software engineers can prepare in 4-6 weeks of evening work using the official Linux Foundation course material plus daily terminal practice on a Vagrant or Multipass VM.</p>
<p>Skip path: if you have used Linux daily for 2+ years (debugging build pipelines, running k8s containers, deploying servers), the cert adds little. Move on. The skills are the point.</p>

<h2>Step 2: Docker and Kubernetes fundamentals (3-4 weeks)</h2>
<p>Before CKA, you need conceptual fluency. The bar: you understand the difference between a container and a VM, you can write a useful Dockerfile, you understand Kubernetes pods, deployments, services, and namespaces, and you can read kubectl output without panic.</p>
<p>Cert option: <strong>KCNA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate)</strong>, $250, multiple choice. Optional but useful as a forcing function for structured study. Most engineers skip KCNA and go straight to CKA prep, using the first 3-4 weeks of CKA study as their fundamentals layer.</p>
<p>Free resource: KodeKloud Kubernetes for Beginners course is the most-recommended free option. Follow it with KodeKloud's CKA labs.</p>

<h2>Step 3: CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) (6-8 weeks)</h2>
<p>The CKA is the cert that DevOps interviews actually probe for. It is hands-on (no multiple choice), 2 hours, performance-based on real Kubernetes clusters. Cost: $445, includes one free retake. The exam currently uses Kubernetes v1.34.</p>
<p>Why it matters: every modern platform team runs Kubernetes somewhere. CKA signals you can operate it, not just deploy YAML files.</p>
<p>Time investment: 6-8 weeks for someone with the prior layers solid. Daily lab work on Killer.sh (free with exam purchase) or a local kind/minikube cluster. The exam tests speed under pressure: 17 tasks in 120 minutes.</p>

<h2>Step 4: one cloud associate cert (8-10 weeks)</h2>
<p>Pick AWS or Azure based on what your employer runs or what your job market demands. Do not study both simultaneously.</p>
<p><strong>AWS path:</strong> SAA-C03 (Solutions Architect Associate), $150. Tests architecture decisions across compute, storage, networking, identity. Most useful for DevOps engineers who will design infrastructure rather than only operate it.</p>
<p><strong>Azure path:</strong> AZ-104 (Azure Administrator), $165. Tests operational configuration. More directly applicable to day-to-day DevOps tasks in an Azure environment.</p>
<p>Either choice is fine. The cloud-specific cert is what differentiates a Kubernetes-only operator from a platform engineer who can wire Kubernetes to managed cloud services (RDS, CloudWatch, IAM, KMS or their Azure equivalents).</p>

<h2>Step 5: HashiCorp Terraform Associate (3-4 weeks)</h2>
<p>HashiCorp Terraform Associate (003), $70.50, 60-minute multiple choice exam. The cheapest cert in this sequence and arguably the highest signal for DevOps roles. Terraform is the de facto IaC standard in 2026, and the cert tests fundamentals that every DevOps engineer is expected to know: state management, modules, providers, workspaces, lifecycle rules, the difference between count and for_each.</p>
<p>Why it matters: in DevOps job interviews in 2026, Terraform fluency is more probed than any single cloud cert. Holding the cert is a small signal; being able to write a working module from scratch is a large one.</p>
<p>Source: HashiCorp Certification page, May 2026. Renewal: 2 years, full re-sit at $70.50.</p>

<h2>Step 6: capstone professional cert (10-14 weeks)</h2>
<p>This is the cert that closes the loop and signals senior-level DevOps capability.</p>
<p><strong>AWS path:</strong> <strong>DOP-C02 (DevOps Engineer Professional)</strong>, $300, 180 minutes. Six domains covering SDLC automation, configuration management and IaC, monitoring and logging, incident response, security and compliance, and resilient cloud solutions. Difficulty: hard. Most candidates need 80-120 hours of study from an SAA-C03 or DVA-C02 baseline.</p>
<p><strong>Azure path:</strong> <strong>AZ-400 (DevOps Engineer Expert)</strong>, $165. Tests Azure DevOps Services and GitHub Actions integration with Azure, plus cross-cutting topics around secure pipelines, IaC, and monitoring. Easier than DOP-C02 in raw difficulty but more specific to Microsoft tooling.</p>

<h2>Time investment summary</h2>

    <tr><td>6</td><td>DOP-C02 or AZ-400</td><td>$165-300</td><td>10-14 weeks</td><td>6-10 weeks</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Total cost: roughly $1,200-$1,500 across all certs. Total time for a starting software engineer: 12-18 months. For an engineer already doing some infrastructure work: 6-9 months.</p>

<h2>What this sequence signals on a resume</h2>
<p>An engineer who completes this sequence has demonstrated: Linux fluency, container orchestration competence, hands-on cloud operations, IaC discipline, and full-stack pipeline design. That is the skill set hiring managers actually probe for in DevOps interviews. The certs are evidence; the work you do alongside them is what produces the offers.</p>

<h2>Verify your shell setup before starting</h2>
<pre><code># Confirm the basic toolchain a DevOps engineer needs locally
docker --version
kubectl version --client
terraform version
aws --version || az --version
git --version
</code></pre>
<p>If any of these commands return an error or "command not found," fix it before opening a study course. The roadmap above assumes you have a working local toolchain on day one.</p>

<p>Important context first: DP-203 (Data Engineering on Microsoft Azure) was retired by Microsoft on March 31, 2025. The successor is <strong>DP-700 (Fabric Data Engineer Associate)</strong>. If you are searching DP-203 vs AZ-204 in 2026, you are almost certainly looking at the question of "data engineer cert or developer cert first?" rather than the literal exam codes. The comparison below answers both: how DP-700 (the live data engineer cert) compares to AZ-204 today, and what to do if you are looking at DP-203 study material online.</p>

<h2>What each exam covers</h2>
<h3>AZ-204 (Developing Solutions for Microsoft Azure)</h3>
<p>AZ-204 is the live Microsoft developer certification. Cost: <strong>$165 USD</strong> via Pearson VUE. The exam covers building Azure-native applications across these areas: Azure App Service, Azure Functions, Azure Storage (Blob, Table, Queue), Cosmos DB at the developer level, Service Bus, Event Grid and Event Hubs, API Management, Azure Container Apps and AKS basics, secure development with Key Vault and Managed Identity, and monitoring with Application Insights.</p>
<p>The bar: you can write code that runs on Azure, integrate with managed services, secure secrets and identities properly, and instrument the application for observability.</p>

<h3>DP-203 (retired) and DP-700 (replacement)</h3>
<p>DP-203 covered Azure Synapse Analytics, Azure Databricks, Azure Stream Analytics, Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2, Cosmos DB at the data engineering level, and the design of batch and streaming pipelines. The exam was retired because Microsoft consolidated its data engineering story around Microsoft Fabric.</p>
<p>DP-700 (Fabric Data Engineer Associate) is the current cert. Cost: <strong>$165 USD</strong>. It covers Microsoft Fabric workloads including Lakehouse, Data Warehouse, Data Factory pipelines in Fabric, Real-Time Intelligence, Spark notebooks, and the OneLake storage layer. It also tests data modelling, SQL transformations, and Spark-based processing.</p>
<p>If you have DP-203 study material from 2024-2025, the underlying concepts (data lake design, batch vs streaming, data modelling, performance tuning) are still valid. The specific tooling has shifted from Synapse and Databricks to Fabric. About 60-70% of conceptual content transfers; the tool-specific knowledge does not.</p>

<h2>Which to take first based on your background</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Background</th><th>Take first</th><th>Why</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Software engineer, Java/.NET/Python web</td><td>AZ-204</td><td>Builds on existing developer skills directly</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Data engineer, on-prem SQL or ETL</td><td>DP-700</td><td>Maps to data engineering work directly</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Data analyst with SQL fluency</td><td>DP-700</td><td>Closer to existing data work; AZ-204 requires application coding</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Backend engineer wanting to do data work</td><td>AZ-204</td><td>Easier ramp; pivot to DP-700 after</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Pure ops or sysadmin</td><td>Neither yet</td><td>AZ-104 first, then either as a specialisation</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h2>Time to prep</h2>
<p>AZ-204: most candidates with 1+ years of Azure development experience need 50-70 hours over 6-8 weeks. Without prior Azure exposure, plan for 90-120 hours over 10-12 weeks. The exam includes code-snippet questions in C# and Python, so reading code under pressure is part of the skill set.</p>
<p>DP-700: most candidates with prior data engineering experience (any platform) need 60-80 hours over 8-10 weeks. The Fabric-specific tooling adds learning curve even for experienced data engineers because Microsoft consolidated several legacy products into a new unified UX.</p>
<p>If you are studying DP-203 material because you found it cheap or already paid for it: stop. Use it as background for the data lake and pipeline design concepts, then study DP-700 specifically for the Fabric-based questions you will see on the live exam.</p>

<h2>Salary uplift expected</h2>
<p>AZ-204 holders in the US earn a median total comp of $140,000-$180,000 at the mid-level (3-5 YoE) per Glassdoor 2026 and Levels.fyi data, depending on the type of employer. The cert correlates with roughly a 5-10% salary uplift over uncertified Azure developers at the same experience level.</p>
<p>DP-700 is too new to have stable salary data. DP-203 data from 2023-2024 showed Azure data engineer roles in the US at $130,000-$170,000 mid-level. Fabric-specific roles in 2026 are appearing in the same band, with consultancies paying a premium because Fabric expertise is still scarce.</p>
<p>In the EU, AZ-204 holders typically earn EUR 60,000-85,000 mid-level (Netherlands, Germany), DP-700 holders EUR 65,000-90,000. The data engineering premium is real and consistent across regions.</p>

<h2>The honest career framing</h2>
<p>If you want to build applications, AZ-204 is the right cert and the path opens to senior backend engineer, full-stack engineer, or Azure-focused application architect. If you want to work with data, DP-700 is the right cert and the path opens to data engineer, analytics engineer, or data platform architect. The two paths increasingly diverge after the associate level: AZ-204 leads to AZ-305 (architect) or AZ-400 (DevOps); DP-700 leads to DP-600 (Fabric Analytics Engineer) or DP-100 (Azure Data Scientist).</p>
<p>One concrete tactical note: if your current job involves writing code that loads or queries data, AZ-204 first will give you immediate utility while you decide whether to pivot toward data engineering. The reverse is less true: DP-700 study assumes Fabric tooling familiarity that does not transfer back to general application development.</p>

<h2>What to verify before booking either exam</h2>
<pre><code># Confirm Azure CLI version (both exams assume current CLI)
az --version

# Verify you have the developer extensions installed if studying AZ-204
az extension list --output table
# Expected: appservice-kube, functionapp, etc.

# For DP-700, confirm you have a Fabric-enabled tenant
az login
# Then sign in to https://app.fabric.microsoft.com to verify access
</code></pre>
<p>The lab work for both exams assumes a working Azure subscription and CLI. Free trial credits cover most of the lab requirements for AZ-204; DP-700 lab work benefits from a Fabric capacity F2 SKU which you can pay-as-you-go.</p>

<p>SC-100 is Microsoft's expert-level cybersecurity architect certification. It is one of the harder Microsoft exams in the security portfolio, and one of the more useful credentials for cloud-native security work. Below is the prep approach that maps to the actual exam, plus the reason this cert is undervalued in many job markets.</p>

<h2>Exam facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cost: <strong>$165 USD</strong> via Pearson VUE</li>
  <li>Format: 40-60 questions including case studies and design scenarios, 100 minutes</li>
  <li>Passing score: 700/1000</li>
  <li>English version last updated: April 27, 2026</li>
  <li>Validity: 1 year, free annual online assessment renewal</li>
</ul>

<h2>The prerequisite reality</h2>
<p>To earn the Microsoft Certified: Cybersecurity Architect Expert credential, you must hold one of the following before SC-100 itself counts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft Certified: Azure Security Engineer Associate (AZ-500)</li>
  <li>Microsoft Certified: Identity and Access Administrator Associate (SC-300)</li>
  <li>Microsoft Certified: Security Operations Analyst Associate (SC-200)</li>
  <li>Microsoft Certified: Information Protection and Compliance Administrator Associate (legacy MS-500)</li>
</ul>
<p>You can sit SC-100 without one of these in hand, but the certification will not be issued until the prerequisite is in place. Plan for two exam fees, not one. Source: Microsoft Learn certification page, accessed May 2026.</p>

<h2>Recommended prerequisite path</h2>
<p>For most engineers, AZ-500 (Azure Security Engineer Associate) is the most useful prerequisite. It covers identity, platform protection, security operations, and data and application security on Azure, and the topics overlap directly with SC-100 case studies. If your role focuses on identity (SSO, MFA, conditional access, governance), SC-300 is the right prerequisite. If you do SOC or threat-hunting work, SC-200 makes sense.</p>

<h2>The four functional groups (skills outline)</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Domain</th><th>Weight</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Design solutions that align with security best practices and priorities</td><td>20-25%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Design security operations, identity, and compliance capabilities</td><td>25-30%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Design security solutions for infrastructure</td><td>25-30%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Design security solutions for applications and data</td><td>20-25%</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>The first domain is the one most candidates underprepare for. Microsoft expects you to apply the Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA), Zero Trust principles, and the Cloud Adoption Framework to design choices. Read these documents directly; do not rely on a course summary.</p>

<h2>Real study resources that work</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Official Microsoft Learn paths for SC-100.</strong> Free, structured, and the closest alignment to the actual question style. Start here. Source: learn.microsoft.com/training.</li>
  <li><strong>Microsoft Cybersecurity Reference Architectures (MCRA).</strong> Free PDF from Microsoft. The exam pulls scenarios directly from these architectures. Read all sections relevant to identity, network, endpoint, and SaaS security.</li>
  <li><strong>Zero Trust Maturity Model.</strong> Microsoft's Zero Trust documentation maps to several SC-100 case study scenarios. Free at microsoft.com/security/business/zero-trust.</li>
  <li><strong>John Savill's SC-100 master class on YouTube.</strong> Free, multi-hour, and covers the design reasoning the exam tests. The most-recommended video resource on r/AzureCertification for this cert.</li>
  <li><strong>MeasureUp practice exams.</strong> Microsoft's official practice partner. The questions are representative of exam style. Around $100 for the full bundle.</li>
  <li><strong>Charbel Nemnom's SC-100 study guide.</strong> Free, written by an MVP, structured by exam domain. Good complement to the Microsoft Learn paths.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Time to prepare</h2>
<p>If you already hold one of the security associate prerequisites and have 2+ years of cloud security experience, plan for 60-90 hours of preparation over 8-10 weeks. If you are coming from a general cloud architecture background without specific security operations experience, budget 120+ hours and consider taking SC-300 or AZ-500 first as scaffolding.</p>

<h2>Why SC-100 is undervalued vs CISSP for cloud-native work</h2>
<p>CISSP is the dominant security credential in many job markets. It signals broad security knowledge across 8 domains and is widely recognised by HR filters. The honest comparison:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>CISSP:</strong> vendor-neutral, broad, requires 5 years of paid security work experience to certify, covers traditional infosec topics plus some cloud. Cost: $749 plus annual maintenance fees of $135 plus 40 CPE credits per year.</li>
  <li><strong>SC-100:</strong> Microsoft-specific, tests design reasoning for Azure-native security, requires a Microsoft associate cert prerequisite, covers Zero Trust, MCRA, Defender, Sentinel, Entra ID. Cost: $165 plus zero renewal fees.</li>
</ul>
<p>For roles where the work is genuinely cloud-native security (designing Azure landing zones with security baked in, Sentinel-based SOC operations, identity-first security architecture), SC-100 tests skills that actually transfer to the day-to-day. CISSP tests breadth that is useful in compliance, audit, and traditional security roles but is less aligned with Azure-specific design work.</p>
<p>In Europe, particularly in financial services and government, CISSP still holds a reputation premium. In US tech and EU consultancies focused on Microsoft cloud, SC-100 holders report comparable or higher offer rates per anonymous reports on r/AzureCertification and Microsoft Tech Community in 2025-2026.</p>

<h2>Salary expectations</h2>
<p>SC-100 holders in the US typically earn $145,000-$200,000 mid-level total comp, $200,000-$280,000 senior, per Glassdoor and Levels.fyi 2026 data for "cybersecurity architect" titles. In the EU, mid-level cybersecurity architects earn EUR 70,000-100,000, senior EUR 100,000-140,000. The cert plus 5+ years of cloud security experience is the threshold for the senior bands.</p>

<h2>Practical preparation plan (10 weeks)</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Weeks 1-2: Microsoft Learn SC-100 paths, full read-through. Take notes by domain.</li>
  <li>Weeks 3-4: MCRA documentation deep dive. Sketch reference architectures from memory after reading.</li>
  <li>Weeks 5-6: Zero Trust documentation plus John Savill master class.</li>
  <li>Weeks 7-8: Practice case studies. Microsoft Learn provides several free; MeasureUp adds depth.</li>
  <li>Week 9: Full-length practice exam. Review every wrong answer against documentation.</li>
  <li>Week 10: Final practice exam plus targeted review of weakest domain. Book the real exam at the end of the week.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What the exam looks like in practice</h2>
<p>SC-100 questions present a fictional company with multiple business and technical constraints, then ask you to design a security solution that meets the constraints. There is rarely one objectively correct answer; there is usually one best-aligned answer given the priorities the question states. The skill being tested is reading carefully, identifying the dominant constraint, and matching the design to it. Practice this with real-world architecture review documents, not only with quiz questions.</p>
<pre><code># Useful for SC-100 study: probe Entra ID conditional access policies
az ad signed-in-user show
az role assignment list --assignee &lt;userPrincipalName&gt; --output table

# List Defender for Cloud security alerts in your subscription
az security alert list --output table
</code></pre>
<p>The exam tests architectural reasoning, not CLI fluency. The commands above are useful for building the mental model of what the architecture you are designing will actually configure.</p>

      {
        q: "Should I take AZ-500 or SC-300 as the SC-100 prerequisite?",

<p>DOP-C02 is the AWS DevOps Engineer Professional certification, replacing the older DOP-C01 in March 2023 and stable through 2026. It is one of the harder AWS exams: 75 questions, 180 minutes, scenario-heavy, with multiple plausible answers per question. Below is the prep approach that maps to the live exam, including honest comparison of the practice exam vendors most candidates reach for.</p>

<h2>Exam facts</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Cost: <strong>$300 USD</strong> via Pearson VUE or PSI</li>
  <li>Format: 75 questions (65 scored, 10 unscored), 180 minutes</li>
  <li>Passing score: 750/1000</li>
  <li>Validity: 3 years; renewal by re-sitting at $300 or by passing a higher specialty</li>
  <li>Recommended experience: 2+ years of AWS production work plus prior SAA-C03 or DVA-C02</li>
</ul>
<p>Source: AWS Certification page and DOP-C02 official exam guide PDF, accessed May 2026.</p>

<h2>Six domains and weightings</h2>
<table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th>Domain</th><th>Weight</th></tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr><td>Domain 1: SDLC Automation</td><td>22%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Domain 2: Configuration Management and IaC</td><td>17%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Domain 3: Resilient Cloud Solutions</td><td>15%</td></tr>
    <tr><td>Domain 4: Monitoring and Logging</td><td>15%</td></tr>

    <tr><td>Domain 6: Security and Compliance</td><td>17%</td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>Source: official DOP-C02 exam guide.</p>

<h2>Time to prep from each baseline</h2>
<p><strong>From SAA-C03 (Solutions Architect Associate):</strong> 80-120 hours over 10-14 weeks. SAA gives you architecture breadth but limited depth on CI/CD pipelines, observability tooling, or incident response patterns.</p>
<p><strong>From DVA-C02 (Developer Associate):</strong> 60-90 hours over 8-10 weeks. DVA covers more pipeline and Lambda content that maps to DOP-C02 directly. This is the easier path if you have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>From SOA-C02 (SysOps Administrator):</strong> 50-70 hours over 6-8 weeks. The most direct ramp because SOA covers monitoring, automation, and operational topics that DOP-C02 builds on.</p>
<p><strong>From scratch (no AWS associate cert):</strong> not recommended. Take SAA-C03 or DVA-C02 first. DOP-C02 expects associate-level fluency as the starting point.</p>

<h2>Hardest sections (honest take)</h2>
<h3>Incident and event response (Domain 5)</h3>
<p>This is the section most candidates underestimate. Questions test your ability to design automated response patterns: EventBridge rules triggering Lambda remediation, Systems Manager Automation runbooks for known failure modes, integration of Security Hub findings with response workflows, and CloudWatch alarms that trigger Auto Scaling or Step Functions.</p>
<p>The challenge: questions are scenario-based with multiple plausible response designs, and the "best" answer depends on subtle constraints (cost, latency, idempotency, blast radius). Practice with case studies, not flash cards.</p>

<h3>CI/CD pipeline design with multi-account (Domain 1)</h3>
<p>The exam frequently tests pipelines that span dev, staging, and production accounts using AWS Organizations and cross-account IAM. Topics include: CodePipeline cross-account deployments, CloudFormation StackSets, AWS CDK pipelines, manual approval gates, blue/green and canary patterns with CodeDeploy, and securing artifact stores across accounts.</p>
<p>The challenge: real-world experience with cross-account setups is the only reliable preparation. Reading documentation alone does not produce the mental model the exam tests.</p>

<h3>Cross-region recovery (Domain 3)</h3>
<p>Questions test trade-offs between RTO/RPO targets, replication patterns (DynamoDB Global Tables vs streams, S3 Cross-Region Replication, RDS read replicas, Aurora Global Database), and failover orchestration with Route 53 health checks plus Lambda or Step Functions.</p>
<p>The challenge: the exam expects you to know which AWS service produces which RPO and at what cost. Memorising service-by-service RTO/RPO characteristics is the only way to answer these questions confidently.</p>

<h2>Practice exam vendor comparison (honest)</h2>
<h3>Stéphane Maarek (Udemy)</h3>
<p>Practice exams: roughly 75 questions per set, 4 sets typical. Cost: $15-20 per set on Udemy (effectively always on sale). Style: question difficulty closely matches the real exam; explanations reference AWS documentation. Pros: well-maintained, accurate, the explanations teach you reasoning patterns. Cons: smaller question pool than Tutorials Dojo. Verdict: best single-vendor pick for DOP-C02, especially if you also took Maarek's video course.</p>

<h3>Tutorials Dojo (Jon Bonso)</h3>
<p>Practice exams: 5-6 sets of 75 questions, with timed mode and review mode. Cost: $15-25 per set on the Tutorials Dojo portal. Style: question difficulty is slightly above the real exam, which is useful for prep but produces a higher false-fail rate during practice. Pros: the largest question pool for DOP-C02, frequent updates, excellent review explanations. Cons: occasional questions are tougher than the real exam, which can dent confidence. Verdict: best for volume; combine with one Maarek set for variety.</p>

<h3>Whizlabs</h3>
<p>Practice exams: 5+ sets of 60-75 questions. Cost: $20-30 per set or subscription model. Style: question quality is more variable; some questions are well-aligned to the real exam, others have outdated or imprecise wording. Pros: cheap, large question volume. Cons: quality control is weaker than Maarek or Tutorials Dojo. Verdict: usable as supplementary practice but not as primary prep.</p>

<h3>Skill Builder (AWS official)</h3>
<p>Practice exams: one official practice exam plus a question set, both included in AWS Skill Builder Subscription ($29/month). Style: written by AWS, closest to actual exam structure. Pros: authoritative source, scenario style identical to real exam. Cons: lower question volume than third-party vendors. Verdict: include this as your final practice exam before booking the real one.</p>

<h2>Recommended prep stack</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Video course:</strong> Stéphane Maarek's "Ultimate AWS Certified DevOps Engineer Professional" on Udemy. Around 30 hours. Watch at 1.5x.</li>
  <li><strong>Official documentation:</strong> AWS exam guide PDF and the AWS Well-Architected Framework documentation. Read both at least twice.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice exams:</strong> Tutorials Dojo (3 sets minimum) plus Maarek (2 sets) plus AWS Skill Builder official practice (1 set). Total cost: approximately $100-130.</li>
  <li><strong>Hands-on labs:</strong> AWS Skill Builder labs or AWS Workshops (free at workshops.aws). Build a working multi-account CodePipeline as practice.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Salary impact</h2>
<p>DOP-C02 holders in the US typically earn $160,000-$220,000 mid-level total comp and $200,000-$300,000 senior, per Glassdoor and Levels.fyi 2026 data. The cert correlates with a 10-15% salary uplift over uncertified DevOps engineers at the same experience level, per the Dice Tech Salary Report 2025-2026. The professional-tier signal is meaningful in interview pipelines for senior platform and SRE roles.</p>

<h2>Hands-on warmup before exam day</h2>
<pre><code># Verify you can spin up a CodePipeline locally for revision
aws codepipeline list-pipelines --output table

# Check CloudFormation drift for a stack
aws cloudformation detect-stack-drift --stack-name &lt;stack&gt;

# Quick health check on a multi-region replication setup
aws s3api get-bucket-replication --bucket &lt;source-bucket&gt;

# Confirm Systems Manager Automation runbooks for incident response
aws ssm list-documents --filters Key=DocumentType,Values=Automation --output table
</code></pre>
<p>If any of these commands return permission errors or unfamiliar output, spend a session resolving the gap before sitting the exam. Comfort at the AWS CLI is what differentiates candidates who pass cleanly from candidates who second-guess themselves under time pressure.</p>

<h2>What is genuinely different</h2>
<h3>Project hierarchy</h3>
<p>AWS organises resources by account; you can have many accounts under an Organization. GCP organises by project, with a separate Organization at the top and Folders in between. Every GCP resource lives inside a project. The project is the unit of billing, IAM scope, and API enablement.</p>
<p>Practical impact: you cannot just "spin up a GCP resource." You first create or select a project, enable the relevant API on the project, configure IAM on the project, and only then create the resource. This is friction that AWS engineers underestimate at the start.</p>

<h3>IAM model</h3>
<p>AWS IAM grants permissions through policies attached to users, groups, or roles. GCP IAM grants roles to identities (users, groups, service accounts) at a specific scope (project, folder, or organization). The same role bound at different scopes produces very different effective permissions.</p>
<p>Key concepts that the ACE exam tests:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Predefined roles vs custom roles:</strong> GCP ships hundreds of predefined roles. The exam expects you to know roles/owner, roles/editor, roles/viewer, and the principle of least privilege.</li>
  <li><strong>Service accounts:</strong> in GCP, service accounts are first-class identities used by applications running on Compute Engine or GKE to authenticate to other GCP services. AWS has IAM roles for similar purposes, but the GCP service account model is more explicit.</li>
  <li><strong>Workload Identity:</strong> the modern way GKE pods authenticate to GCP APIs. Comparable to IRSA in AWS EKS but with different setup.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Networking</h3>
<p>The biggest mental model shift: GCP VPCs are global by default, with subnets per region. You can have a single VPC that spans all GCP regions. AWS VPCs are regional; cross-region traffic requires VPC peering or Transit Gateway.</p>
<p>Practical impact: networking design in GCP is simpler for global apps and harder to mentally separate for engineers used to AWS regional thinking. The exam tests Shared VPC, VPC peering, Cloud NAT, Cloud Router, and Cloud Interconnect.</p>

<h3>Billing and quotas</h3>
<p>GCP has per-project quotas that you frequently bump into during lab work. AWS has account-level service quotas. The exam tests how to view and request quota increases through the GCP console and gcloud CLI.</p>

<h2>Time to prep</h2>
<p><strong>From AWS Pro level (SAP-C02 or DOP-C02):</strong> 4-6 weeks of evening study. The mental model transfers; you spend most prep time learning gcloud syntax and the GCP-specific concepts above.</p>
<p><strong>From AWS Associate (SAA-C03 or equivalent):</strong> 6-9 weeks. Add time for deeper hands-on with GCP-specific services like BigQuery, Pub/Sub, and GKE.</p>
<p><strong>From AWS Cloud Practitioner only:</strong> 10-14 weeks. The cert is achievable but you are essentially learning cloud concepts and GCP simultaneously.</p>

<h2>Recommended study resources</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Coursera Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer Professional Certificate</strong> (free to audit). Six-course series covering exam topics. Source: coursera.org/professional-certificates/cloud-engineering-gcp.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Cloud Skills Boost</strong> (formerly Qwiklabs). Hands-on labs in real GCP environments. Around $29/month subscription. The fastest way to get gcloud muscle memory.</li>
  <li><strong>Dan Sullivan's GCP Associate Cloud Engineer Study Guide</strong> (Sybex / Wiley). Covers exam objectives systematically; useful as a structured reference.</li>
  <li><strong>Practice exams:</strong> Whizlabs and ExamTopics for volume; Tutorials Dojo for quality (smaller GCP catalogue than AWS but the questions that exist are well-written).</li>
  <li><strong>Free Google Cloud documentation:</strong> the cloud.google.com docs are unusually well-written. Read the IAM, VPC, and Compute Engine sections directly.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The honest career framing</h2>
<p>Adding GCP ACE to an AWS-heavy resume is most useful in three scenarios: you are pivoting to a multi-cloud or platform engineering role, your employer is starting GCP adoption, or you are targeting data-engineering roles where BigQuery is the standard analytics warehouse. For pure AWS-only career trajectories, GCP ACE adds limited value compared to deepening AWS expertise.</p>
<p>Salary impact: holding both AWS SAA-C03 and GCP ACE correlates with roughly a 5-8% additional salary uplift versus AWS-only at the same experience level, per Dice Tech Salary Report 2025-2026 data. The signal is strongest at companies running multi-cloud or evaluating cloud migration.</p>

<h2>Quick gcloud commands AWS engineers should learn first</h2>
<pre><code># Authenticate and set the active project
gcloud auth login
gcloud config set project &lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;
gcloud config list

# List Compute Engine VMs (the EC2 equivalent)
gcloud compute instances list

# List Cloud Storage buckets (the S3 equivalent)
gcloud storage buckets list

# Check IAM bindings on the current project
gcloud projects get-iam-policy &lt;PROJECT_ID&gt;

# Enable an API on the project (no AWS analogue, this is GCP-specific)
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com
</code></pre>
<p>The "enable API" step is the one that catches AWS engineers most often. In GCP, services are off by default per project, and you cannot use them until you enable the corresponding API. There is no equivalent step in AWS.</p>

<p>AZ-104 is the foundation. AZ-700 is the specialty. The question is whether the specialty pays back the time investment, and the answer depends almost entirely on the kind of work you target. Below is the direct comparison plus the honest take on where AZ-700 actually moves the needle.</p>

<h2>Scope difference</h2>
<p>AZ-104 covers Azure operations broadly: identities and governance, storage, compute, virtual networking basics, and monitoring. The networking domain on AZ-104 is roughly 15-20% of the exam and tests foundational concepts: VNets, subnets, NSGs, basic load balancers, simple peering, and VPN Gateway basics.</p>
<p>AZ-700 is networking-specific and goes deep on the topics AZ-104 only touches:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>VNet peering at scale:</strong> hub-and-spoke topologies, transit, gateway transit, encrypted peering</li>
  <li><strong>ExpressRoute:</strong> circuit types, peering models, ExpressRoute Direct, ExpressRoute Global Reach, FastPath</li>
  <li><strong>Azure Firewall:</strong> Standard vs Premium, rule processing order, threat intelligence, IDPS, TLS inspection</li>
  <li><strong>Azure Front Door:</strong> Standard, Premium, classic; routing rules, WAF integration, caching behaviour</li>
  <li><strong>Application Gateway:</strong> v1 vs v2, autoscaling, WAF v2, mutual TLS, header rewrite</li>
  <li><strong>Azure Bastion:</strong> Standard vs Premium SKU, host pools, native client support</li>
  <li><strong>Private DNS, Private Endpoints, Private Link, Service Endpoints:</strong> the four overlapping options for private connectivity, when each applies, cost trade-offs</li>
  <li><strong>Network monitoring:</strong> Network Watcher, Connection Monitor, NSG flow logs, Traffic Analytics, VNet flow logs (the newer offering replacing some NSG flow log scenarios)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Time to prep AZ-700 from AZ-104</h2>
<p>Most candidates with a fresh AZ-104 need 50-70 hours of focused study over 6-8 weeks. Candidates without strong networking fundamentals (TCP/IP, BGP, routing tables) need additional time on the foundations. Candidates with prior Cisco or Juniper networking experience can compress this to 30-40 hours because the conceptual layer transfers directly.</p>

<h2>Salary delta in 2026</h2>
<p>Azure Network Engineers (AZ-700 holders) in the US earn $130,000-$160,000 mid-level and $165,000-$220,000 senior, per Glassdoor 2026 data. Compared with AZ-104-only Azure Administrators at the same experience level, the specialty cert correlates with roughly a 10-20% salary uplift in roles where networking is the primary responsibility.</p>
<p>In the EU, AZ-700 holders at consultancies (Avanade, Insight, Atos, Sopra Steria) earn EUR 75,000-95,000 mid-level versus EUR 65,000-85,000 for AZ-104-only consultants. The premium is consistent and reflects the genuine scarcity of engineers who can design ExpressRoute topologies and Azure Firewall rule sets.</p>
<p>In-house roles at SaaS companies show a smaller delta (5-10%) because most SaaS companies do not run complex hybrid network topologies; the specialty knowledge has fewer use cases.</p>

<h2>Job market reality</h2>
<h3>Where AZ-700 matters most</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Enterprise Azure migrations:</strong> banks, healthcare, government, large retail. These companies move on-prem workloads to Azure and need engineers who can design ExpressRoute, hub-and-spoke topologies, and complex firewall rules. AZ-700 is frequently a hiring filter.</li>
  <li><strong>Microsoft consultancies:</strong> Avanade, Insight, EPAM, Sopra Steria. Migration projects involve heavy networking work, and partner-status requirements push consultancies to maintain certified networking specialists.</li>
  <li><strong>Hybrid cloud and multi-cloud connectivity roles:</strong> companies running Azure plus on-prem or Azure plus AWS need network engineers who can wire the two together. AZ-700 plus AWS Advanced Networking specialty is a powerful combination.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Where AZ-700 matters less</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cloud-native SaaS:</strong> companies building applications that run entirely in the cloud, often without on-prem connectivity. The networking design is simpler and AZ-104 networking knowledge is usually sufficient.</li>
  <li><strong>Pure DevOps and platform engineering:</strong> the focus is CI/CD, Kubernetes, and observability. Networking is a smaller part of the job.</li>
  <li><strong>Startup engineering:</strong> small teams, simple architectures. Networking specialists are rarely hired below 50 engineers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>The decision framework</h2>
<p>Take AZ-700 if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your current or target job involves enterprise hybrid connectivity (ExpressRoute, VPN, hub-and-spoke)</li>
  <li>You work at or want to work at a Microsoft consultancy doing migration projects</li>
  <li>You enjoy networking work and want to specialise rather than stay general-purpose</li>
  <li>You have already cleared AZ-104 and are looking for a high-signal next cert that is not a full architecture jump</li>
</ul>
<p>Skip AZ-700 if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your job runs cloud-native SaaS workloads with simple network topologies</li>
  <li>You target DevOps or platform engineering roles where Kubernetes and CI/CD are the differentiators</li>
  <li>You plan to move to AZ-305 (Azure Solutions Architect Expert) next; the architecture cert covers networking at the design level and is more broadly recognised</li>
</ul>

<h2>AZ-305 versus AZ-700: a common confusion</h2>
<p>AZ-305 tests architecture design across all Azure domains, including networking design at the conceptual level (when to choose Front Door vs Application Gateway vs Traffic Manager, when to use ExpressRoute vs VPN, etc.). AZ-700 tests implementation of the networking topology that an AZ-305 architect would design. They are complementary, not competing.</p>
<p>Practical recommendation: if you are an architect or aspire to be one, AZ-305 is the right next cert. If you are an engineer who will own the implementation and operation of complex Azure networking, AZ-700 is the right next cert. Many senior engineers in enterprise consultancies hold both.</p>

<h2>Study plan: 8 weeks for AZ-700 from AZ-104</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Weeks 1-2:</strong> Microsoft Learn AZ-700 paths. Cover hybrid connectivity (VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute) and core VNet topics.</li>
  <li><strong>Weeks 3-4:</strong> Application delivery (Application Gateway, Front Door, Load Balancer) and security (Azure Firewall, NSG, ASG, Private Link).</li>
  <li><strong>Weeks 5-6:</strong> Hands-on labs in a personal Azure subscription. Build a hub-and-spoke topology with Azure Firewall, deploy Application Gateway with WAF, set up Private Endpoint to a Storage Account.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 7:</strong> Practice exams (MeasureUp official, plus Whizlabs for volume). Review every wrong answer against documentation.</li>
  <li><strong>Week 8:</strong> Final practice exam, targeted review, and book the real exam.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Useful CLI commands for AZ-700 hands-on prep</h2>
<pre><code># Create a hub VNet (typical AZ-700 lab starting point)
az network vnet create \\
  --name vnet-hub \\
  --resource-group rg-network-lab \\
  --address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 \\
  --subnet-name AzureFirewallSubnet \\
  --subnet-prefix 10.0.1.0/26

# Set up VNet peering between hub and spoke
az network vnet peering create \\
  --name hub-to-spoke \\
  --resource-group rg-network-lab \\
  --vnet-name vnet-hub \\
  --remote-vnet vnet-spoke \\
  --allow-vnet-access \\
  --allow-forwarded-traffic

# Verify effective routes on a NIC (the most useful AZ-700 troubleshooting command)
az network nic show-effective-route-table \\
  --name nic-vm01 \\
  --resource-group rg-network-lab \\
  --output table
</code></pre>
<p>The effective route table command is the single most useful tool for diagnosing networking issues in Azure. AZ-700 questions repeatedly probe scenarios where the effective routes are not what the candidate expects; muscle memory on this command translates to faster troubleshooting in real production work.</p>
