      topic: 'Zero Trust',
      question:
        "A security architect describes a model where every request is authenticated, authorised, and encrypted as if it came from an untrusted network. Which security model does this describe?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Perimeter security." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Shared responsibility." },
        { id: 'c', text: "Defence in depth." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Zero Trust." },
      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        "Zero Trust assumes breach and verifies every request explicitly, regardless of network origin. Perimeter security trusts traffic once it is inside the corporate network, which is the opposite assumption.",
    },
    {
      id: 'sc900-2',
      topic: 'Zero Trust',
      question:
        "Which three guiding principles define the Zero Trust model in Microsoft documentation?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Patch quickly, segment networks, monitor endpoints." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Trust but verify, encrypt everything, log everything." },
        { id: 'c', text: "Verify explicitly, use least privileged access, assume breach." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Authenticate once, authorise centrally, audit yearly." },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "Microsoft defines Zero Trust through three principles: verify explicitly, use least privileged access, and assume breach. The other lists describe good practices but are not the official Zero Trust pillars.",
    },
    {
      id: 'sc900-3',
      topic: 'Shared Responsibility',
      question:
        "Under the shared responsibility model for SaaS, who is responsible for protecting the user accounts and the data inside the SaaS application?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "The cloud provider only." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Neither party; SaaS providers absorb all risk." },
        { id: 'c', text: "The cloud provider and the customer share it equally." },
        { id: 'd', text: "The customer only." },
      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        "Information, data, devices, accounts, and identities always remain the customer's responsibility, even in SaaS. The provider runs the platform, network, and physical layers.",

      topic: 'Defence in Depth',
      question:
        "A company layers controls so that an attacker who bypasses one control still meets another. Which security strategy is this?",

        { id: 'd', text: "Federation." },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "Defence in depth uses multiple overlapping controls so that no single failure exposes the environment. Single sign-on is an authentication convenience, not a layered defence.",
    },
    {
      id: 'sc900-5',
      topic: 'Encryption',
      question:
        "Which statement about symmetric and asymmetric encryption is correct?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Symmetric encryption uses two different keys; asymmetric uses one shared key." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Hashing is a form of symmetric encryption." },
        { id: 'c', text: "Asymmetric encryption is always faster than symmetric encryption." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Symmetric encryption uses the same key for encryption and decryption." },
      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        "Symmetric encryption uses a single shared key for both operations. Asymmetric uses a key pair (public and private), and hashing is a one-way function that is not encryption at all.",
    },
    {
      id: 'sc900-6',
      topic: 'Hashing',
      question:
        "Why does a password manager store hashes of passwords rather than the passwords themselves?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Hashes can be reversed only by the original user." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Hashes encrypt the password with the user's public key." },
        { id: 'c', text: "Hashes are smaller and use less disk space." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Hashing is a one-way function, so the original password cannot be recovered from the stored value." },
      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        "A hash is a one-way mathematical function. Even if the database leaks, attackers cannot directly recover the password, although weak hashes can still be cracked by brute force.",
    },
    {
      id: 'sc900-7',
      topic: 'GRC',
      question:
        "Which acronym groups the practices of governance, risk, and compliance into a single discipline?",

      ],
      correctId: 'd',

      topic: 'Identity as Perimeter',
      question:
        "Why do modern security strategies describe identity as the new security perimeter?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Firewalls have been replaced by identity providers in every datacentre." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Compliance regulations forbid network-level controls." },
        { id: 'c', text: "On-premises networks no longer exist." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Users sign in from anywhere on any device, so identity is the consistent control plane that follows them." },
      ],
      correctId: 'd',
      explanation:
        "With cloud and mobile work, the network boundary is no longer a reliable trust line. Identity becomes the consistent control plane across applications and devices.",
    },
    {
      id: 'sc900-9',
      topic: 'Authentication vs Authorisation',
      question:
        "A user proves who they are by entering a password and an authenticator code. They are then granted access to a SharePoint site based on their group membership. Which two concepts are illustrated in order?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Authorisation, then authentication." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Authentication, then authorisation." },
        { id: 'c', text: "Federation, then provisioning." },
        { id: 'd', text: "Auditing, then authentication." },
      ],
      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        "Authentication proves identity; authorisation decides what that identity may do. The user authenticated with password and MFA, then the system authorised access based on group membership.",

      id: 'sc900-10',
      topic: 'Encryption at Rest and in Transit',
      question:

        { id: 'd', text: "Only at rest." },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        "HTTPS protects data in transit. Storage encryption protects data at rest. Encryption in use, such as confidential computing, would require a different mechanism.",
    },
    {
      id: 'sc900-11',
      topic: 'Compliance Concepts',
      question:
        "What is the difference between a regulation such as GDPR and a standard such as ISO 27001?",
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: "Regulations are voluntary; standards are legally binding." },
        { id: 'b', text: "Regulations are laws enforced by governments; standards are frameworks an organisation can adopt and certify against." },

      ],
      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        "Regulations such as GDPR are laws with legal penalties. Standards such as ISO 27001 are frameworks that organisations adopt voluntarily, often for certification.",
    },

      id: 'sc900-12',
      topic: 'Privacy',
      question:
        "Which privacy principle states that an organisation should collect only the personal data needed for a stated purpose and nothing more?",

      ],
      correctId: 'c',

      ],
      correctId: 'b',
      explanation:
        "A tenant is the dedicated Entra ID directory created when an organisation signs up for a Microsoft cloud service. Subscriptions and management groups are Azure resource concepts.",

      topic: 'Hybrid Identity',
      question:
