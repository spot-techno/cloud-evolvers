      question:
        'A regional logistics company needs frontline supervisors to submit daily vehicle inspection reports from a mobile device. No one on the team has coding experience. Which Power Platform service is the best fit?',
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Power Apps canvas app, to build a mobile-friendly form connected to a data source.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'Power Automate desktop flows, to script the inspection form on a PC.' },
        { id: 'c', text: 'Power Pages, to publish the form as a public-facing website.' },
        { id: 'd', text: 'Power BI, to collect inspection data through an interactive report.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'a',
      explanation:
        'Power Apps canvas apps let makers build mobile-friendly forms without code. Power Automate desktop flows automate PC tasks rather than capture field data. Power Pages is for external-audience websites, and Power BI is for analytics visualization, not data capture.',
    },

      id: 'pl900-2',
      topic: 'Business Value',
      question:
        'A finance team wants to see a live, filterable view of invoice data pulled from multiple systems every morning. Which Power Platform service delivers this best?',
      options: [
        { id: 'a', text: 'Power BI, to build an interactive report from connected data sources.' },
        { id: 'b', text: 'Power Apps model-driven app, to display invoice records in a form.' },
        { id: 'c', text: 'Microsoft Copilot Studio, to let users query invoices with natural language.' },
        { id: 'd', text: 'Power Pages, to expose the invoice list on an intranet portal.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'a',
      explanation:
        'Power BI is designed for interactive analytics and live dashboard views across multiple data sources. Model-driven apps focus on record management, Copilot Studio builds conversational agents, and Power Pages creates data-driven websites rather than analytics dashboards.',
    },
    {
      id: 'pl900-3',
      topic: 'Business Value',
      question:
        'A healthcare company wants to let patients book appointments on a public website that writes directly into Microsoft Dataverse. Which Power Platform service is purpose-built for this?',

        { id: 'd', text: 'AI Builder, to process appointment request documents automatically.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        'Power Pages (formerly Power Apps Portals) is designed to create external-facing websites where unauthenticated and authenticated users interact with Dataverse data. Canvas apps are not optimized for public web delivery, and Power Automate handles automation rather than UI.',
    },
    {
      id: 'pl900-4',
      topic: 'Business Value',
      question:
        'An IT help desk receives the same 50 questions repeatedly via Teams chat. A manager wants to deflect those questions without hiring more staff. Which Power Platform capability fits best?',

        { id: 'c', text: 'Power Automate scheduled flow, to email FAQ answers every morning.' },
        { id: 'd', text: 'Power Pages, to publish a FAQ site that users visit manually.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'a',
      explanation:
        'Microsoft Copilot Studio lets makers build agents that handle repetitive questions over channels such as Teams. Sentiment analysis classifies text tone rather than answering questions. A scheduled email is not interactive, and a FAQ site requires users to navigate to it rather than getting answers inline.',

        { id: 'd', text: 'Power BI paginated reports, to extract data from the desktop app.' },
      ],
      correctId: 'c',
      explanation:
        'Power Automate desktop flows (RPA) can automate Windows applications by recording and replaying UI interactions, with no API required. Cloud flows work with cloud-based connectors, not local desktop UIs. Canvas apps and Power BI do not interact with legacy desktop application UIs.',

      ],
      correctId: 'a',
      explanation:
        'Power Platform integrates with Microsoft 365 services including Teams, Outlook, and SharePoint using standard connectors. Teams integration for approvals uses the standard Microsoft Teams connector and does not require a premium license or Copilot Studio.',
    },
    {

        'The AI Builder text recognition prebuilt model uses OCR to extract printed and handwritten text from images. It is available as a control in canvas apps, allowing real-time text extraction from camera captures. Document processing works on structured forms with predefined fields, not arbitrary photos of physical nameplates.',
